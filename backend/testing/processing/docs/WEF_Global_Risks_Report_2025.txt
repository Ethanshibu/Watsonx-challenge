Preface
The multi-decade structural forces highlighted in 
last year’s Global Risks Report – technological 
acceleration, geostrategic shifts, climate change 
and demographic bifurcation – and the interactions 
they have with each other have continued their 
march onwards. The ensuing risks are becoming 
more complex and urgent, and accentuating a 
paradigm shift in the world order characterized by 
greater instability, polarizing narratives, eroding trust 
and insecurity. Moreover, this is occurring against a 
background where today’s governance frameworks 
seem ill-equipped for addressing both known and 
emergent global risks or countering the fragility that 
those risks generate. 
This is the 20th edition of the Global Risks 
Report. Looking back over the last two decades, 
environmental risks have steadily consolidated their 
position as the greatest source of long-term concern. 
This year’s Global Risks Perception Survey shows 
that a sense of alarm is also mounting in the shorter 
term: Environmental problems, from extreme weather 
to pollution, are here now and the need to implement 
solutions is urgent. 
Concerns about state-based armed conflict and 
geoeconomic confrontation have on average 
remained relatively high in the ranks over the last 20 
years, with some variability. Today, geopolitical risk 
– and specifically the perception that conflicts could 
worsen or spread – tops the list of immediate-term 
concerns. Fear and uncertainty cloud the outlook in 
various parts of the world, including in Ukraine, the 
Middle East, and Sudan, with multilateral institutions 
struggling to provide effective mediation and work 
towards resolutions.
Societal risks such as inequality rank high among 
today’s leading concerns as well as over the 
last years. Polarization within societies is further 
hardening views and affecting policy-making. It also 
continues to fan the flames of misinformation and 
disinformation, which, for the second year running, 
is the top-ranked short- to medium-term concern 
across all risk categories. Efforts to combat this risk 
are coming up against a formidable opponent in 
Generative AI-created false or misleading content 
that can be produced and distributed at scale. 
More broadly, technological risks, while not seen as 
immediate, rise in the rankings for the 10-year time 
horizon, given the rapid pace of change in areas 
such as AI and biotech. 
Saadia Zahidi 
Managing Director
Economic risks have fallen in the rankings since 
last year, with inflation and the risk of an economic 
downturn no longer top of mind among decision-
makers and experts. But there is no room for 
complacency: if the coming months see a spiral of 
tariffs and other trade-restricting measures globally, 
the economic consequences could be significant. 
Elevated valuations in several asset classes make 
them more vulnerable to these and other risks.
In this report we dive deep into key global risk 
themes – conflict, trade wars, and technology 
and polarization as leading short- to medium-term 
concerns, as well as pollution, biotech and super-
ageing as areas where serious risks could unfold 
over a longer-term time horizon. We also provide 
a retrospective view of the last two decades of 
assessing global risks. Twenty years ago, when 
we were preparing our first Global Risks Report, 
the world was in a different place. Risks that have 
been well managed and mitigated since then were 
those where the concerted and collective efforts of 
multistakeholder leaders helped to build common 
ground, compromises and mutually acceptable 
solutions. It will be up to visionary leaders to involve 
all key stakeholders to address the risks now 
foreseen for the next decade and to build durable 
peace and prosperity. 
The report highlights the latest findings from our 
annual Global Risks Perception Survey, which this 
year brought together the collective intelligence of 
over 900 global leaders across academia, business, 
government, international organizations and civil 
society. It also leverages insights from some 100 
thematic experts, including the risk specialists who 
form the Global Risks Report Advisory Board, the 
Global Future Council on Complex Risks, and the 
Chief Risk Officers Community. We would also 
like to express our gratitude to the core team that 
developed this report – Mark Elsner and Grace 
Atkinson – and to Ricky Li, Ignacio Moreno and 
Gayle Markovitz for their support. 
The world has changed profoundly over the last 20 
years and will continue to do so in unpredictable 
ways. But foresight based on informed, expert views 
remains critical for better planning and preparation, 
in both the short and long term. The 20th Global 
Risks Report continues to shine a light on globally 
relevant risks that are often complex and sometimes 
alarming. Yet, in examining the trajectory of the risks 
foreseen over the last two decades, it is clear that 
there is no viable alternative to multilateral solutions 
going forward. Leaders across the public and private 
sectors, civil society, international organizations and 
academia must seize the baton to work openly and 
constructively with each other. By deepening honest 
dialogue and acting urgently to mitigate the risks that 
lie ahead, we can rebuild trust and together create 
stronger, more resilient economies and societies.

Overview of 
methodology
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) 
has underpinned the Global Risks Report for two 
decades and is the World Economic Forum’s 
premier source of original global risks data. This 
year’s GRPS has brought together leading insights 
on the evolving global risks landscape from over 900 
experts across academia, business, government, 
international organizations and civil society. 
Responses for the GRPS 2024-2025 were collected 
between 2 September and 18 October 2024.
“Global risk” is defined as the possibility of the 
occurrence of an event or condition that, if it occurs, 
would negatively impact a significant proportion 
of global GDP, population or natural resources. 
Relevant definitions for each of the 33 global risks 
are included in Appendix A: Definitions and 
Global Risks List.
The GRPS 2024-2025 included the following 
components: 
	–
Risk landscape invited respondents to assess 
the likely impact (severity) of global risks over 
one-, two- and 10-year horizons to illustrate the 
potential development of individual global risks 
over time and identify areas of key concern.
	–
Consequences asked respondents to consider 
the range of potential impacts of a global risk 
arising, to highlight relationships between risks 
and the potential for compounding crises.
	–
Risk governance invited respondents to reflect 
on which approaches have the most potential 
for driving action on global risk reduction and 
preparedness.
	–
Outlook asked respondents to predict the 
evolution of key aspects underpinning the global 
risks landscape.
Appendix B: Global Risks Perception 
Survey 2024-2025 provides more detail on the 
methodology. 
To complement GRPS data on global risks, the 
report also draws on the World Economic Forum’s 
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) to identify 
risks that pose the most severe threat to each 
country over the next two years, as identified by 
over 11,000 business leaders in 121 economies. 
When considered in context with the GRPS, this 
data provides insight into local concerns and 
priorities and points to potential “hot spots” and 
regional manifestations of global risks. Appendix 
C: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk 
Perceptions provides more detail.
Finally, the report integrates the views of leading 
experts to generate foresight and to support 
analysis of the survey data. Contributions were 
collected from 59 colleagues across the World 
Economic Forum’s platforms. The report also 
harnesses qualitative insights from 96 experts 
from across academia, business, government, 
international organizations and civil society 
through community meetings, private interviews 
and thematic workshops conducted from April 
to November 2024. Experts included members 
of the Global Risks Report Advisory Board, the 
Global Future Council on Complex Risks and 
the Chief Risk Officers Community. Refer to

Key findings
The Global Risks Report 2025 presents the findings 
of the Global Risks Perception Survey 2024-
2025 (GRPS), which captures insights from over 
900 experts worldwide. The report analyses global 
risks through three timeframes to support decision-
makers in balancing current crises and longer-term 
priorities. Chapter 1 explores current or immediate-
term (in 2025) and short- to medium-term1 (to 2027) 
risks, and Chapter 2 focuses on the risks emerging 
in the long term (to 2035). The report considers 
not only the survey findings and the range of 
implications, but also provides six in-depth analyses 
of selected risk themes. 
Below are the key findings of the report, in which 
we compare the risk outlooks across the three time 
horizons.
Declining optimism
As we enter 2025, the global outlook is increasingly 
fractured across geopolitical, environmental, 
societal, economic and technological domains. 
Over the last year we have witnessed the expansion 
and escalation of conflicts, a multitude of extreme 
weather events amplified by climate change, 
widespread societal and political polarization, and 
continued technological advancements accelerating 
the spread of false or misleading information. 
Optimism is limited as the danger of miscalculation 
or misjudgment by political and military actors 
is high. We seem to be living in one of the most 
divided times since the Cold War, and this is 
reflected in the results of the GRPS, which reveal 
a bleak outlook across all three time horizons – 
current, short-term and long-term. 
A majority of respondents (52%) anticipate an 
unsettled global outlook over the short term (next 
two years), a similar proportion to last year (Figure A). 
Another 31% expect turbulence and 5% a stormy 
outlook. Adding together these three categories 
of responses shows a combined four percentage 
point increase from last year, indicating a heightened 
pessimistic outlook for the world to 2027.
Compared to this two-year outlook, the landscape 
deteriorates over the 10-year timeframe, with 62% 
of respondents expecting stormy or turbulent 
times. This long-term outlook has remained similar 
to the survey results last year, in terms of its level 
of negativity, reflecting respondent skepticism 
that current societal mechanisms and governing 
institutions are capable of navigating and mending 
the fragility generated by the risks we face today.
Deepening geopolitical and 
geoeconomic tensions
Comparing this year’s findings for the world in 
2025 with the two-year risk outlook provided 
by the GRPS two years ago shows how far

perceptions have darkened when it comes to 
conflict. State-based armed conflict, now ranked 
as the #1 current risk by 23% of respondents 
(Figure B), was overlooked as a leading two-year 
risk two years ago.
In a world that has seen an increasing number 
of armed conflicts over the last decade,2 national 
security considerations are starting to dominate 
government agendas. Section 1.3: "Geopolitical 
recession" dives deep into the dangers of

unilateralism taking hold in national security 
considerations and highlights the worsening 
humanitarian impacts of the ongoing conflicts.
The risk of further destabilizing consequences 
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as 
in the Middle East and in Sudan are likely to be 
amplifying respondents’ concerns beyond 2025 as 
well. In the two-year outlook, State-based armed 
conflict has moved up from #5 to #3 since our 
GRPS 2023-24 (Figure C). 
Section 1.4: Supercharged economic tensions 
explores how global geoeconomic tensions 
could unfold. The rise in the two-year ranking of 
Geoeconomic confrontation, from #14 last year to 
#9 today reflects unease about the path ahead for 
global economic relations. The role of technology 
in geopolitical tensions also concerns respondents, 
with Cyber espionage and warfare ranked #5 in 
the two-year outlook. 
However, the top risk in 2027 is Misinformation 
and disinformation, for the second year in a 
row (Figure C). There are many ways in which 
a proliferation of false or misleading content is 
complicating the geopolitical environment. It is a 
leading mechanism for foreign entities to affect 
voter intentions; it can sow doubt among the 
general public worldwide about what is happening 
in conflict zones; or it can be used to tarnish the 
image of products or services from another country.
A growing sense of societal 
fragmentation
Societal fractures are central to the overall risks 
landscape, as shown in the risk interconnections 
map (Figure D). Inequality (wealth, income) is 
perceived as the most central risk of all, playing 
a significant role in both triggering and being 
influenced by other risks. It is contributing to 
weakening trust and diminishing our collective 
sense of shared values. 
As well as Inequality, other societal risks also 
feature in the top 10 of the two-year ranking: 
Societal polarization, Involuntary migration or 
displacement and Erosion of human rights and/
or civic freedoms. The importance ascribed to this 
set of societal risks by respondents suggests that 
social stability will be fragile over the next two years. 
Respondent concern around certain key economic 
risks – Economic downturn and Inflation – has 
subsided since last year, with these two risks 
witnessing the largest falls in the two-year ranking 
(Figure 1.5). Nonetheless, the impacts of the cost-
of-living crisis since 2022 contributed to Inequality 
becoming the top interconnected risk this year: 
Economic downturn, Inflation, and Debt were 
selected among the top causes of Inequality by 
GRPS respondents.   
Although there are fewer societal risks in the top 
10 of the 10-year risk ranking than in the top 10 
of the two-year risk ranking (two compared to 
four, see Figure C), the profound societal fractures 
that feature prominently in this report should not 
be perceived as solely short-term risks. Looking 
ahead to the next decade, Inequality and Societal 
polarization continue to feature among the top 10 
risks. This is an important pair of risks to watch, 
given how related they can be to bouts of social 
instability, and in turn to domestic political and to 
geostrategic volatility. In super-ageing societies 
– such as Japan, South Korea, Italy or Germany – 
unfavourable demographic trends could accentuate 
these risks over the next 10 years. Pensions

sector are likely to become acute and widespread 
problems in super-ageing societies, with no easy 
fix for governments. Section 2.5: Super-ageing 
societies explores this risk theme. 
Environmental risks - from long-
term concern to urgent reality
The impacts of environmental risks have worsened 
in intensity and frequency since the Global Risks 
Report was launched in 2006, as discussed in 
depth in Section 2.6: Looking back: 20 years of 
the Global Risks Report. Moreover, the outlook 
for environmental risks over the next decade 
is alarming – while all 33 risks in the GRPS are 
expected to worsen in severity (Figure E) from the 
two-year to the 10-year time horizon, environmental 
risks present the most significant deterioration. 
Extreme weather events are anticipated to 
become even more of a concern than they already 
are, with this risk being top ranked in the 10-year 
risk list for the second year running. Biodiversity 
loss and ecosystem collapse ranks #2 over the 
10-year horizon, with a significant deterioration 
compared to its two-year ranking.
The GRPS shows generational divergence when it 
comes to risk perceptions related to environmental

issues, with younger survey respondents being 
more concerned about this over the next 10 years 
than older age groups. Take Pollution, for example, 
which the under 30s rank as the #3 most severe 
risk in 2035, the highest of any age group surveyed. 
As noted in last year’s Global Risks Report, there 
is also divergence in how Pollution is ranked by 
stakeholder, with the public sector placing Pollution 
as a top 10 risk in the 10-year ranking, but not the 
private sector (Figure 2.4). Section 2.3: Pollution 
at a crossroads aims to fill awareness gaps by 
exploring under-appreciated pollutant risks that 
need to become more prominent in policy agendas 
by 2035 – and ideally much sooner given their 
significant impacts on health and ecosystems.
Technological risks - still “under 
the radar”
In a year that has seen considerable experimentation 
by companies and individuals in making the best use 
of AI tools, concerns about Adverse outcomes of 
AI technologies are low in the risk ranking on a two-
year outlook. However, complacency around the risks 
of such technologies should be avoided given the 
fast-paced nature of change in the field of AI and its 
increasing ubiquity. Indeed, Adverse outcomes of AI 
technologies is one of the risks that climbs the most 
in the 10-year risk ranking compared to the two-year 
risk ranking (Figure G). In this report we highlight the 
role of Generative AI (GenAI) in producing false or 
misleading content at scale, and how that relates to 
societal polarization. Section 1.5: Technology and 
polarization explores this and the broader risks from 
greater connectivity, rapid growth in computing power 
and more powerful AI tools.  
Among the areas experiencing the most rapid 
technological advances is the Biotech sector. 
Section 2.4: Losing control of biotech? takes 
an in-depth look at emerging risks in biotech, 
supercharged by AI. Over a 10-year time horizon, 
low-probability, high-impact risks exist, including 
Intrastate violence from biological terrorism and 
Adverse outcomes of frontier technologies 
involving accidental or malicious misuse of gene 
editing technologies, or even of brain-computer 
interfaces. At the same time, such risks do not

diminish the tremendous actual and potential 
progress for humankind stemming from biotech.
The time to act is now - is 
consensus possible in a 
fragmenting world? 
Deepening divisions and increasing fragmentation 
are reshaping international relations and calling into 
question whether existing structures are equipped 
to tackle the challenges collectively confronting 
us. Levels of global cooperation across many 
areas of geopolitics and humanitarian issues, 
economic relations, and environmental, societal and 
technological challenges may reach new lows in the 
coming years. Key countries appear to be turning 
inward, focusing on mounting domestic economic 
or societal concerns, just when they should be 
seeking to strengthen multilateral ties to confront 
shared challenges. 
When asked about the characteristics of the global 
political outlook over the next decade, 64% of GRPS 
respondents believe that we will face a Multipolar 
or fragmented order, in which middle and great 
powers contest, set and enforce regional rules and 
norms (Figure F). Perceptions in response to this 
question have changed little compared to last year. 
The Western-led global order is expected to continue 
its decline over the next decade but will nonetheless 
remain an importance locus of power. Alternative 
power centres are likely to strengthen, not just led by 
China, but also by key emerging powers, including 
India and the Gulf states.     
The decade ahead will be pivotal as leaders will be 
confronted with increasingly complex global risks. 
But to prevent a downward spiral in which citizens 
worldwide will be worse off than before, ultimately 
there is no option other than to find avenues for 
dialogue and collaboration.4

Global Risks 2025: 
A world of growing 
divisions
1
The current geopolitical climate, following Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and with wars raging in 
the Middle East and in Sudan, makes it nearly 
impossible not to think about such events when 
assessing the one global risk expected to present 
a material crisis in 2025: close to one-quarter 
of survey respondents (23%) selected State-
based armed conflict (proxy wars, civil wars, 
coups, terrorism, etc.) as the top risk for 2025 
(Figure 1.1). Compared with last year, this risk has 
climbed from #8 to #1 in the rankings. Geopolitical 
tensions are also associated with the rising risk of 
Geoeconomic confrontation (sanctions, tariffs, 
investment screening), ranking #3, which is also 
driven by Inequality, Societal polarization and 
other factors.
The risks associated with Extreme weather events 
also is a key concern for the year ahead, with 14% 
of respondents selecting it. The burden of climate 
change is becoming more evident every year, as 
pollution from continued use of fossil fuels such as 
coal, oil and gas leads to more frequent and severe 
extreme weather events. Heatwaves across parts 
of Asia; flooding in Brazil, Indonesia and parts of 
Europe; wildfires in Canada; and hurricanes Helene 
and Milton in the United States are just some recent 
examples of such events.
Similar to last year, Misinformation and 
disinformation and Societal polarization 
remain key current risks, in positions #4 and #5 
respectively. The high rankings of these two risks is 
not surprising considering the accelerating spread 
of false or misleading information, which amplifies 
the other leading risks we face, from State-based 
armed conflict to Extreme weather events. 
A sense of increasingly fragmented societies is 
reflected by four of the top 10 risks expected to 
present a material crisis in 2025 being societal in 
nature: Societal polarization (6% of respondents),

Lack of economic opportunity or unemployment 
(3%), Erosion of human rights and/or civic 
freedoms (2%) and Inequality (2%). 
On the economic front, Inflation is perceived as 
less of a concern this year than in 2024. However, 
perceptions of the overall economic outlook for 
2025 remain fairly pessimistic across all age groups 
surveyed. The risk of an Economic downturn 
(recession, stagnation) continues to be a common 
concern among respondents, coming in at #6 (5% 
of respondents), the same position as last year. 
The perceived vulnerabilities associated with the 
Economic downturn risk are higher for younger 
age groups: it is ranked #3 for under 30s, #4 for the 
30-39-year age group and #5 for the 40-49-year
age group (Figure 1.2), but does not even feature in
the top 10 for those aged 60 years or older.

The global outlook for 2027 is one of increased 
cynicism among survey respondents, with a high 
proportion of respondents to the GRPS 2024-25 
anticipating turbulence (31%), a four percentage-
point increase since last year’s edition (Figure 1.3). 
There is also a two percentage-point year-on-year 
increase to 5% in the number of respondents 
who are anticipating a stormy outlook – the most 
alarming of the five categories respondents were 
asked to select from – over the next two years. 
The top risk for 2027 according to survey 
respondents is Misinformation and disinformation 
– for the second year in a row, since it was introduced
into the GRPS risk list in 2022-23. Respondent
concern has remained high following a year of “super
elections”, with this risk also a top concern across a
majority of age categories and stakeholder groups
(Figures 1.6 and 1.7). Moreover, it is becoming more
difficult to differentiate between AI- and human-
generated Misinformation and disinformation. AI
tools are enabling a proliferation in such information

AI technologies is low in the risk ranking. In fact, 
it has slightly declined in the two-year outlook, with 
the risk now ranking #31 compared with #29 in 
last year’s report. However, complacency around 
the risks of such technologies should be avoided 
given the fast-paced change in the field of AI and 
its increasing ubiquity. In this report we highlight 
how AI models are a factor in the relationship 
between technology and polarization. Section 1.5: 
Technology and polarization explores the risks for 
citizens resulting from the combination of greater 
connectivity, rapid growth in computing power, and 
more powerful AI models. In Section 2.4: Losing 
control of biotech? we highlight the role of AI in 
accelerating developments in this field, for both 
good and bad.
Respondents also express unease over Cyber 
espionage and warfare, which is #5 in the 
two-year ranking, echoing concerns outlined in 
the World Economic Forum's 2024 Chief Risk 
Officers Outlook, where 71% of Chief Risk Officers 
expressed concern about the impact of Cyber 
risk and criminal activity (money laundering, 
cybercrime etc.) severely impacting their 
organizations. The rising likelihood of threat actor 
activity and more sophisticated technological 
disruption were noted as particular concerns.6
Elevated cyber risk perceptions are one aspect of 
a broader environment of heightened geopolitical 
and geoeconomic tensions, which is reflected in the 
two-year ranking of State-based armed conflict 
moving up from #5 in last year’s report to #3 now. 
The risk of further destabilizing consequences in 
Ukraine, the Middle East, and Sudan are likely 
to be amplifying respondents’ concerns. In a 
world that has been seeing an increasing number 
of armed conflicts for a decade, as detailed in 
Section 1.3: "Geopolitical recession", national 
security considerations are increasingly dominating 
government agendas. That section of the report 
dives deep into the dangers of unilateralism taking 
hold, including its implications for deepening 
humanitarian crises. 
Overall, the GRPS risks with some of the sharpest 
rises in ranking compared to the previous year 
are geostrategic in nature. Biological, chemical, 
or nuclear weapons or hazards (#23) and 
Geoeconomic confrontation (#9) are up eight 
and five positions, respectively, since the GRPS 
2023-24. Section 1.4: Supercharged economic 
tensions explores how global geoeconomic 
tensions could unfold over the next two years. 
Private-sector concern with the two-year outlook 
for Geoeconomic confrontation has moved up 
from last year’s edition of the report, where it was 
not a top 10 risk; it now is #6. There is also concern 
among both governments and academia, who rank 
this risk #9 and #10, respectively (Figure 1.7).

Last year, two economic risks – Inflation and 
Economic downturn (recession, stagnation) – 
were new entrants in the top 10 ranking. Concerns 
around both have since subsided; in this year’s 
two-year risk ranking, there are no economic 
risks in the top 10. Inflation, which was #7 last 
year, has fallen to #29, with a similar decline for 
Economic downturn, which was #9 last year and 
is now #19. No stakeholder group selected either 
Inflation or Economic downturn as a top 10 risk, 
although there is ongoing concern about Debt 
among government stakeholders (at #7), and Crime 
and illicit economic activity among international 
organizations, private-sector and government 
respondents (#6, #7 and #8, respectively). Across 
stakeholders in the aggregate, however, there are 
some sharp upticks in economic risk perceptions, 
with Crime and illicit economic activity increasing 
17 positions to #11, and Concentration of 
strategic resources at #12, up 12 positions from 
last year. 
This overall mixed picture for economic risk 
perceptions is not mirrored in societal risk 
perceptions, which have risen and feature 
prominently in the two-year risk landscape. 
Inequality (wealth, income) is #7 and Societal 
polarization is even higher, at #4. Involuntary

migration or displacement (#8), and Erosion of 
human rights and/or civic freedoms (#10) are 
also in the top 10. Lack of economic opportunity 
or unemployment has increased 17 positions 
from last year’s edition and is now #13. Inequality 
(wealth, income) is perceived as the most central, 
interconnected risk of all, with significant potential 
to both trigger and be influenced by other risks 
(Figure 1.8). The importance ascribed to this set of 
societal risks suggests that social stability will be 
fragile over the next two years, weakening trust and 
diminishing our collective sense of shared values. 
This is being felt not only within societies but also 
between societies and governments: the perceived 
risk of Censorship and surveillance (#16) is up five 
places compared to last year.
Fractures across societal lines are also relevant to 
environmental risks, which have become a more 
divisive issue in domestic politics in many countries 
in recent years. On aggregate across GRPS 
respondents, concerns about environmental risks 
are high over the two-year horizon. Respondents 
list Extreme weather events as the #2 most severe 
risk for 2027, with Pollution at #6, up four places 
from last year’s report. While Extreme weather 
events remain a persistent concern year-on-year 
– the risk was also ranked #2 last year – the uptick
in Pollution demonstrates that environmental
risks that are often perceived as long-term threats
are starting to be perceived with more certainty
by respondents as short-term realities, as their
effects become more apparent. Climate change is
also an underlying driver of several other risks that
rank high. For example, Involuntary migration or
displacement is a leading concern, at #8.
The following sections explore in-depth three risk 
themes and examine how these could play out 
over the next two years. State-based armed 
conflict (#3) and Geoeconomic confrontation 
(#9) are, respectively, at the core of Section 
1.3: "Geopolitical recession" and Section 
1.4: Supercharged economic tensions, while 
Section 1.5: Technology and polarization 
explores the links between Societal polarization 
(#4), Misinformation and disinformation (#1), 
algorithmic bias and Censorship and surveillance 
(#16).

Over the next two years, uncertainty around the course of current conflicts and their aftermath is likely to
remain high, and tensions elsewhere could escalate.	
–
A loss of support for and faith in the role of international organizations in conflict prevention and
resolution has opened the door to more unilateralist moves.	
–
Humanitarian crises are multiplying and worsening, given funding constraints and major powers’ lack of
sustained focus on them.
State-based armed conflict (proxy wars, civil 
wars, coups, terrorism, etc.) was highlighted as by 
far the greatest risk for 2025 among the 33 risks 
ranked in the GRPS, with 23% of respondents 
anticipating a material global crisis. GRPS 
respondents cite Geoeconomic confrontation 
as well as the technology-related concerns Cyber 
espionage and warfare and Misinformation 
and disinformation among the risks most closely 
linked to State-based armed conflict (Figure 1.10). 
Concern about this risk among respondents 
remains alarming on a two-year horizon, with State-
based armed conflict ranked #3, increasing two 
positions from last year’s risk ranking. 
In the EOS, Armed conflict – encompassing 
interstate, intrastate, proxy wars and coups – is 
identified as one of the top 10 global risks over 
the next two years. According to the EOS, this 
geopolitical risk ranks as the primary concern for 
executives in 12 countries, including Armenia, Israel, 
Kazakhstan and Poland, and features among the 
top five risks in an additional 11 economies, such as 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia (Figure 1.11). Executives who 
prioritize this risk according to the EOS frequently 
cite a high perception of related risks, including 
Biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons or 
hazards and Geoeconomic confrontation.
The top ranking of State-based armed conflict 
may also demonstrate concern among respondents 
that we are in what has been termed a “geopolitical

number of conflicts, in which multilateralism is 
facing strong headwinds. It can also be argued 
that such a geopolitical recession started almost 
a decade ago (see Figure 1.12). Since 2014, the 
number of armed conflicts has been elevated 
compared to the period from the 1990s to the 
early 2010s. Interstate conflicts, while they tend to 
present the greatest threats to global stability, only 
constitute a small proportion of the total number of 
armed conflicts, which also include one-sided, non-
state and intrastate armed conflicts.
Escalation pathways 
The GRPS results are also likely to reflect the depth 
of respondents’ fears surrounding the two major 
current cross-border conflicts, Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, and 
perhaps also concern around the risks of conflict 
over Taiwan, China. 
Regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the position 
taken by the new US administration will be critical 
to its evolution. Will the United States take a firmer 
stance towards Russia, counting on such a move 
acting as a deterrent to further Russian escalation, 
and/or will it increase pressure on Ukraine, including 
reducing financial support? In the latter case, 
European governments might increase their own 
support for Ukraine. The spectrum of possible 
outcomes over the next two years is wide, ranging 
from further escalation, perhaps also involving 
neighbouring countries, to uneasy agreement to 
freeze the conflict. 
In the Middle East, any shift towards a full-scale 
Iran-Israel war over the next two years would draw 
in the United States further. Such a war would, in 
turn, generate more long-term instability in the entire 
region, including the Gulf economies, where US 
military bases could become targets. Meanwhile, 
recent political developments in Syria raise both 
opportunities and risks. Hopes are high that there 
could be a revitalization of the economy and a more 
inclusive political environment. However, building 
stability across Syria will be challenging, given the 
many competing interests that are involved. These 
include both domestic groups and foreign states; 
if other countries decide to intervene more heavily 
while the transition unfolds, this could lead to 
renewed confrontations.
In addition, conflict over Taiwan, China cannot be 
ruled out. Limited armed confrontation could be 
triggered more easily if global tensions are high 
around geoeconomic confrontation and if rhetoric

is aggressive. Both the United States and China 
may go further in the coming years in undertaking 
military manoeuvres close to Taiwan, China 
designed to show strength and act as deterrent. A 
major risk is that just one such manoeuvre could 
be misinterpreted by the other side and/or lead to 
accidental loss of life or destruction of hardware, 
leading to tit-for-tat military escalation.
Waning appetite for 
multilateralism 
With the world facing this wide spectrum of ongoing 
armed conflicts, and escalation risks in the two major 
cross-border conflicts, the current weakness of the 
multilateral security framework with the UN Security 
Council (UNSC) at its core is alarming. The UNSC 
has not managed to stop conflicts from escalating, 
including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the wars in 
the Middle East and in Sudan. 
Despite discussions over the last year about 
reinvigorating UN peacekeeping operations, these 
are in decline on aggregate, with their size having 
been reduced from over 100,000 peacekeepers in 
20168 to around 68,000 in 2024.9 
The UNSC faces ongoing structural challenges,10 
and over the next two years risks having even less 
impact, given the new US administration’s likely 
less favourable stance towards the UN generally 
and its preference for seeking solutions to conflicts 
unilaterally. There is a danger that more governments 
lose faith not only in the UNSC, but in multilateralism 
as a forum for resolving conflicts, and that the world 
instead becomes more adversarial, with conflicts 
ending only via battlefield, winner-takes-all victories 
and not through negotiated, multistakeholder peace 
agreements. While there continue to be discussions 
that aim towards reform of the UNSC, they are 
unlikely to make meaningful progress over the next 
two years given the complexity of aligning national 
interests and the current lack of political will to do 
so. Furthermore, there is no viable alternative global 
governance set-up in sight. 
The growing vacuum in ensuring global stability at 
a multilateral level will lead governments around 
the world increasingly to take national security 
matters into their own hands, coordinating 
security and defense efforts only with select allied 
countries, or making unilateral military decisions. 
More countries will attempt to gain a greater 
degree of autonomy and self-sufficiency. Defense 
budgets could be prioritized over other long-term

investments, placing at risk spending in areas such 
as healthcare, education and infrastructure. This 
accelerating military spending would represent 
a continuation of recent trends: World military 
expenditure increased for the ninth consecutive 
year in 2023, reaching a total of $2.4 trillion,11 with 
2023 seeing a steep rise over 2022 (see Figure 
1.13). The top five countries accounted for 61% 
of the total. As governments with strengthening 
militaries perceive that multilateral constraints 
on unilateral military action are weaker, there 
could be more instances of cross-border military 
interventions in the coming years.
Unilateralism and the dominance of national security 
considerations in political agendas may also 
have increasingly far-reaching repercussions for 
state-society relations worldwide. Increased state 
surveillance of citizens and restrictions on individual 
freedoms may become more commonplace in 
the name of national security. Perceived or actual 
threats from other countries also provide an opening 
for governments to seize control of narratives 
and suppress information, perhaps blurring the 
lines between genuine security considerations 
and political expedience. Governments may take 
measures that diminish the transparency of public 
expenditure, for example when it comes to funding 
parties to a conflict abroad. These are all conditions 
that will help authoritarian regimes consolidate their 
power and may lead to democratic regimes taking 
on more authoritarian characteristics.

Worsening humanitarian crises
Even beyond global security considerations, 
multilateralism appears set to endure its most 
difficult period since the founding of the UN in 1945. 
Over the next two years, more questions are likely 
to be asked by national governments about the 
roles and priorities of key multilateral institutions, 
and there could be constraints placed on their 
funding. The outlook for this broader weakening of 
multilateralism is associated with declining global 
budgets for humanitarian aid (see Figure 1.14).
Declining funding translates into an acute risk of 
humanitarian crises deepening. Global humanitarian 
efforts are highly dependent on the financial and 
human resources and institutional know-how 
provided by the UN. This know-how, in areas such 
as logistics or relationships with local governments 
and NGOs, has been built up over decades and 
is irreplaceable over a short- or even medium-
term time horizon. Over 90 million people in need 
receive humanitarian aid or development assistance 
from UN institutions on an annual basis.12 A rising 
number of these individuals, as well as others 
who also need support but are unable to access 
it, will be at increasing risk of insecurity, disease, 
malnutrition and starvation over the next two years 
if UN institutions and the humanitarian sector overall 
are weakened further. 
Furthermore, higher levels of desperation will in some 
settings create more opportunities for armed groups 
to recruit. Countries in which serious humanitarian 
crises risk deepening further over the next two years 
and in turn fueling more violence include Sudan, 
Mali and Haiti. In Sudan, the domestic and regional 
impacts of reduced agricultural production and 
exports are already far-reaching. Like Ukraine, Sudan 
is a large exporter of agricultural products. It plays a 
critical role for neighbouring countries Ethiopia, South 
Sudan, Chad and Egypt.13
Forced displacement is also set to rise as 
international humanitarian aid efforts struggle to 
keep up. It is already at an all-time high, with over 
122 million forcibly displaced people globally,14 
and 56% are displaced within their own countries. 
Among the 44% who are cross-border refugees, 
three quarters are hosted in low-income countries 
that have limited resources to support them. 
Sometimes refugees are confronted with nationalist 
sentiment or identity-related violence because of 
their ethnicity or religion, further fueling the potential 
for conflict in border areas. Increased competition

for jobs between refugees and locals can also be a 
source of tensions.  
Rising unilateralism will have softer implications, too. 
Societies are developing more disinterested mindsets 
when it comes to conflicts and humanitarian crises 
in which their own citizens are not involved. As 
local media deprioritize reporting on “far-away” 
conflicts, a self-fulfilling cycle emerges, with greater 
tolerance by governments and societies of civilian 
casualties in warfare. This is a risk that has already 
started unfolding with respect to current conflicts, 
for example when it comes to Sudan: This war 
has rarely been at the top of global policy agendas 
despite its huge humanitarian toll. Such disinterest 
makes internationally coordinated humanitarian 
responses more difficult, especially when combined 
with the prevailing geopolitical and funding 
conditions.  
Actions for today
A. Support multilateral institutions
The GRPS finds that the approach that respondents 
believe has the most long-term potential for driving 
action on risk reduction and preparedness regarding 
State-based armed conflict is Global treaties 
and agreements (Figure 1.15. See also Figure 
1.16), followed by Multistakeholder engagement. 
These findings strongly suggest that it is critical 
for public, private and civil society stakeholders 
across all countries to work together to reinforce 
existing multilateral institutions wherever feasible. 
This includes the UN Security Council; despite 
the challenges and complexity of reforming it, 
governments should continue dialogues with that 
ultimate objective in mind.
In highlighting the benefits of multilateralism in conflict 
resolution, leaders should draw on case studies 
of resolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. An 
example was the Colombian government’s peace 
agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC) in November 2016. Broad 
international cooperation has also helped to tackle 
armed threats, for example in combating piracy off 
the Somali coast over the course of many years 
from 2008. Global leaders can draw optimism from 
such examples and showcase lessons learned and 
actionable strategies for ending current conflicts.
B. Expand the role of regional organizations in
managing tensions
Amid the current challenges facing global 
multilateralism, there is space for regional 
organizations to expand their roles in managing

geopolitical tensions in their regions. The African 
Union is a good example: It already has a track 
record in this regard, having carried out several 
peacekeeping operations across Africa and on other 
occasions has played a mediator role.15 Nonetheless, 
there is a need for it to play a greater role in future in 
both peacekeeping and mediation.
C. Diversify supply chains 
For organizations, one of the big lessons taken 
from the ongoing conflicts is the need for supply 
chain resilience and diversification. With geopolitical 
volatility likely to remain high over the next two years, 
organizational investment in geopolitical risk foresight 
and risk management is a must. When the level of 
uncertainty around conflicts or potential conflicts is 
high, scenario planning exercises can be a valuable 
tool to help organizations prepare for a range of 
different outcomes. Organizations need to consider 
not only whether their suppliers and supply routes are 
vulnerable to conflicts, but also what the reputational 
risks are of partnering or doing business with 
counterparts that are in any way party to a conflict.

Supercharged economic tensions
1.4
	–
A worldwide escalation of broad tariff-based protectionism could lead to global trade declining.
	–
Deeper decoupling of trade between West and East would have worldwide repercussions, even beyond 
trade relationships. 
	–
With economic growth in China and Europe already weak, an escalating trade war will introduce 
additional uncertainties into the global economic outlook.
Global trade relations are tense and there is a risk of 
unpredictable and potentially sharp changes in trade 
policies worldwide. Geoeconomic confrontation 
(sanctions, tariffs, investment screening) ranks #3 
for current (2025) risks according to the GRPS and 
#9 over a two-year horizon. This comes after trade 
tensions have already been rising steeply since 
2017. According to Global Trade Alert, the number 
of harmful new policy interventions per year rose 
globally from 600 in 2017 to over 3,000 in each of 
2022, 2023 and 2024.16
The incoming US administration has suggested 
that it will implement higher tariffs on imports 
from all trading partners, often singling out China, 
as well as Mexico and Canada. While these 
statements may have been the opening gambits 
ahead of future negotiations covering trade and 
other issues, they undoubtedly are a signal to the 
rest of the world that deepening protectionism is 
on the agenda.
US trading partners are considering retaliatory 
measures, as well as the timing for potentially 
implementing them. Over the next two years, there 
is a significant risk of escalating tariffs and other 
trade-related protectionism globally, which could 
accelerate broader decoupling between the United 
States and China, and their respective allies. While 
Cold War-style rhetoric between the United States 
and China could ramp up and fuel trade tensions 
between the two blocs, even the many countries 
that are not aligned with either West or East would 
find themselves affected by these tensions. 
In such an unfolding trade war scenario, initiatives 
currently underway could easily stall or come apart. 
For example, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism is more likely to face retaliation from 
trading partners; and efforts to cooperate in the 
area of digital regulation will come up against 
hardening negotiating positions. These and other 
initiatives need ongoing collaboration to keep 
moving forward.   
Across-the-board tariffs 
In a worst-case scenario for tariff escalation over 
the next two years, governments would decide to 
impose tariffs not only on those countries/blocs 
imposing tariffs on them, but instead on all their 
trading partners. This widespread imposition of 
across-the-board tariffs globally would lead to a 
substantial contraction in global trade.17
This scenario could originate from an escalation 
of the tariff conflict between the United States 
and China. The latter’s dominance of global 
export markets is at the core of the new US 
administration’s concerns. Not only in the United 
States, but manufacturing sectors worldwide have 
struggled to compete with Chinese products in a

range of sectors, such as solar panels or electric 
vehicles. While Chinese exports slowed from 2022-
2023,18 their growth has remained strong over a 
five-year timeframe. 
If Chinese access to the US market is constrained 
by new tariffs, Chinese exports will be likely to flow 
to EU and other markets. But the EU has already 
started pushing back in selected areas of trade 
with China, for example imposing tariffs on electric 
vehicles imports from China for a period of five 
years in October 2024.19 If faced with a potential 
influx of Chinese imports redirected from the United 
States, the EU might impose new tariffs on Chinese 
imports.
Other regions such as Latin America could take 
similar approaches in the face of diverted imports 
as they aim to defend local industries. Over the next 
two years, this could lead to a pattern of rolling, 
progressive protectionism spreading worldwide, at 
different speeds in different sectors, going well-
beyond bilateral tit-for-tat tariffs. Some governments 
would move more aggressively than others, and 
once the first countries impose across-the-board 
tariffs on their trading partners, more countries 
could quickly follow.
Escalation beyond tariffs
Research published in November 2024 assessed 
the vulnerability of 173 countries to restrictive 
US trade measures. The research considers key 
concerns of US policy-makers, including those 
countries’ bilateral trade surpluses with the United 
States, restrictions on market access for US 
exports, and existing tariffs, among other criteria.20 
Weighing the countries according to these criteria, 
South Korea is found to be the most at risk for 
being targeted with restrictive US trade measures, 
followed by China, Japan, Canada and India, at 
the next level of risk. However, other countries and 
blocs are found to be at risk, too: Brazil, the EU, 
Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico 
and Thailand are the next group of economies.21
This assessment chimes with the results of 
the EOS, which show that geoeconomic 
confrontation (sanctions, tariffs, investment 
screening, etc.) is a prominent concern in Eastern 
Asia, in particular (Figure 1.18). In Taiwan, China 
and Hong Kong SAR, China, this risk is the third-
most significant concern in their two-year outlooks. 
Moreover, 12 other economies, including Japan 
and South Korea, rank geoeconomic confrontation 
among their top 10 risks. While Eastern Asia may

be one region most immediately impacted by new 
trade restrictions, broadening global geoeconomic 
fragmentation would affect all economies, with 
those likely to suffer the most ultimately being 
emerging markets and low-income countries.22
Beyond tariffs, industrial policy is at the core of 
other trade-related protectionist measures. The 
world is already in an era of industrial policy, with a 
high number of non-tariff barriers impacting trade 
relations. Two-thirds of all harmful trade restriction 
measures implemented in the last five years have 
been subsidies,23 excluding export subsidies. 
Legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act24 
or initiatives such as Make in India25 are a rising 
characteristic of countries’ inward focus and this 
trend could accelerate in a fragmenting trade 
environment. Although industrial policy can have 
benefits, for example addressing market failures, 
its risks include corruption and misallocation of 
resources.26 A related area likely to see escalation 
is more blocking of trade and investment on 
national security grounds, with the number of 
sectors classified by governments as “strategically 
sensitive” expanding.
As the space for a multilateral, rules-based 
and open global trade environment diminishes, 
government interventions in the private sector 
could be used more frequently as a form of 
retaliation against companies’ home governments. 
Employees of foreign companies could increasingly 
be prosecuted or have more restrictions placed 
on their in-country stays, and the number and 
size of fines imposed on companies for alleged 
regulatory non-compliance could be ratcheted up. 
Governments may make more use of sanctions 
targeting individuals, financial transactions  
and companies.
Some governments may foment more aggressive 
Misinformation and disinformation campaigns 
about goods and services from targeted countries. 
Results from the EOS indicate widespread 
concerns about the Misinformation and 
disinformation risk in a diverse set of countries, 
including India (#2), Germany (#4), Brazil (#6), 
and the United States (#6). Hardening public 
perceptions could lead to more frequent consumer 
boycotts of products.
Costs for companies doing business internationally 
will rise in this scenario. Global firms will need to 
navigate divergent sets of regulations in different, 
fragmenting parts of the world. Regulatory 
technology (RegTech) will be used more by 
governments to surveil foreign companies and 
ensure compliance,27 reducing the time between 
new regulations being imposed and the need 
for companies to become fully compliant. IT 
infrastructure as well as data security and storage 
protocols will continue to be adapted to national 
security interests at the expense of cross-border 
commercial considerations. Finally, international 
data flows and financial transactions will become 
more cumbersome and costly, setting back some 
of the rapid progress made in recent years through 
the implementation of new technologies.
Government-led efforts at commercial cyber 
espionage could become more frequent as part of 
efforts to tilt the playing field towards their national 
champions. The EOS reveals that respondents in high-
income countries tend to highlight cybersecurity risk. 
In some of these – for example Denmark, Luxembourg 
and the Netherlands – Cyber insecurity is one of the 
top three risks. Governments may also put pressure 
on domestically headquartered cloud services 
companies to restrict access in other countries.

Such a global fragmentation scenario will weaken 
the kind of multilateral collaboration required in 
many fields. For example, coordinating regulatory 
efforts and mobilizing the vast financial resources 
needed for the green transition will become much 
more difficult. Technological innovations that might 
make a difference towards greening economies 
will face more impediments to being shared across 
borders and scaled globally. Other areas where 
deeper global collaboration is badly needed, such 
as global health, energy or infrastructure, will also 
be likely to see slowdowns or reversals in progress. 
This will leave the world less well prepared for the 
next global pandemic, for example, while urgent 
public health and broader humanitarian issues 
will slip even further down the global agenda. 
Contagion from trade disruptions could spill over 
into food insecurity, too. Some large cities in Sub-
Saharan Africa that are reliant on global commodity 
markets for their food supply are particularly at risk.
Greater economic uncertainty 
The World Economic Forum’s September 2024 
Chief Economists Outlook found that most of 
the chief economists surveyed (54%) expect 
the condition of the global economy to remain 
unchanged over the next year, but four times as 
many expect conditions to weaken (37%) rather 
than to strengthen (9%).28 This outlook aligns 
closely with the latest IMF forecast, which has 
economic growth stable at 3.2% annually in 2024 
and 2025.29 Even without accounting for the 
potential impacts of downside risks, this growth rate 
is tepid compared to the long-term average growth 
rate of 3.8% from 2000-2019.30
The IMF notes rising risks to the economy posed 
by conflict escalation, tariffs and trade policy 
uncertainty, lower migration, and the tightening of 
global financial conditions.31 The latter could pose a 
challenge to financial stability given that valuations 
are elevated in several asset classes and the 
amount of leverage used by financial institutions is 
significant.32 The rapid growth in the private credit 
market is one area to monitor.33 More generally, 
both government and private-sector debt levels

Eastern Asia and Southern Asia. It also ranks first 
in three out of the four country income groups, 
with the only exception being lower-middle income 
countries. Respondents in 25 countries see 
Economic downturn as the leading risk, including 
developed economies such as the United States 
and United Kingdom, and emerging markets such 
as Brazil, Kenya and Malaysia (Figure 1.19).
In the short term, higher import tariffs cause an 
increase in the price of imported goods. The impact 
on global GDP depends on factors including the 
substitutability between imported and domestic 
goods; the response of exporting firms facing tariffs; 
and monetary policy reactions.36 When it comes 
to the latter, monetary policy-makers are in the 
fortunate position of having just brought inflation 
back under control. The International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) projects headline global inflation to fall to 
3.5% by the end of 2025, which is lower than the 
average in the two decades prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic.37 However, one risk is that an escalating 
trade war will lead to another upturn in inflation, 
forcing central banks to halt or even reverse course 
from cutting interest rates. If this is associated with 
a strengthening US dollar, there could be knock-on 
risks for countries and companies with US dollar 
debt refinancing needs. 
Indirect impacts of tariffs include a fall in 
productivity, due to a change in the allocation of 
productive resources from more to less productive, 
more protected sectors and firms; a rise in the cost 
of capital caused by financial stress; and a drop in 
investment due to an increase in uncertainty about 
future business conditions, which causes firms 
to adopt a “wait-and-see” approach.38 The latest 
World Investment Report, released in June 2024, 
cites fragmenting trade and regulatory environments 
as among the key drivers of a 10% slump in global 
foreign direct investment last year.39
Analysis by the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
of the phase of the US-China trade conflict from 
2018-2020 indicates that the direct impacts on the 
global economy of tariff increases during this period 
were far outweighed by the impacts of broader 
uncertainty around trade policy. With these broader 
impacts, the loss to global GDP was estimated 
at 0.34-0.50% during this period.40 A true global 
trade war would have correspondingly more severe 
impacts, with estimates of global GDP losses highly 
uncertain but potentially much higher.41
The US-China trade conflict since 2018 also had 
clear business impacts: exits of foreign companies 
from China increased by 34% compared to pre-
2018 levels.42 Importantly, the impacts were much 
broader than only in the specific sectors targeted by 
US tariffs on Chinese products and affected non-
US companies as well as US companies. These 
findings suggest that even the “scalpel” approach 
– levying tariffs on specific sectors – does not have 
a well-targeted outcome in terms of either sector 
or geography.43 To reiterate, a broader global trade 
war would magnify these impacts on businesses. 
Actions for today
A. Foster multilateralism 
The GRPS finds that the approach that has the most 
long-term potential for driving action on risk reduction 
and preparedness regarding Geoeconomic 
confrontation is Global treaties and agreements 
(Figure 1.20). A specific area to prioritize would be

a revival of reforms at the WTO to address dispute 
resolution, tariff-setting rules and digital trade issues. 
With US-China Geoeconomic confrontation at the 
core of a fragmenting world, more opportunities will 
open up for rising powers, such as India or the Gulf 
countries, to fill the void and propose multilateral 
alternatives to the current global political economic 
order. These countries can also benefit by acting as 
a bridge between West and East, even though they 
too will suffer many of the negative impacts of the 
fragmenting environment. Smaller countries will face 
increasing pressure to align with the West or the East 
in their trade relationships.
B. Develop strategic relationships 
Governments could consider further prioritizing 
efforts to develop strategic regional or bilateral ties 
with countries that offer complementarity in terms of 
sectoral strengths, natural resource endowments and 
skills. “Deep” regional trade agreements – outside 
the WTO but consistent with WTO requirements 
– and WTO-based plurilateral44 or “minilateral” 
agreements can be considered (Figure 1.21).45 Even 
at these levels, multistakeholder dialogue needs to 
be deepened to reinforce the message that well-
designed deepening of trade can lead to mutually 
beneficial economic and social outcomes. 
C. Strengthen domestic economic resilience 
In an environment where trade becomes more costly 
and cumbersome, emphasis needs to be placed 
on policies that strengthen the domestic economy, 
such as financial sector development or investment 
in education, health and infrastructure. On the 
supply side, developing greater self-sufficiency in 
key strategic sectors such as Energy, Agriculture, 
and Defense will increasingly become an important 
aspect of resilience at the national level.

–
Rising use of digital platforms and a growing volume of AI-generated content are making divisive
misinformation and disinformation more ubiquitous.	
–
Algorithmic bias could become more common due to political and societal polarization and associated
misinformation and disinformation.	
–
Deeper digitalization can make surveillance easier for governments, companies and threat actors, and
this becomes more of a risk as societies polarize further.
An estimated two-thirds of the world’s population 
– 5.5 billion people46 – is online and over five billion
people use social media.47 The increasing ubiquity
of sensors, CCTV cameras and biometric scanning,
among other tools, is further adding to the digital
footprint of the average citizen. In parallel, the
world’s computing power is increasing rapidly.48
This is enabling fast-improving AI and GenAI
models to analyse unstructured data more quickly
and is reducing the cost to produce content. With
Societal polarization ranking #4 in the GRPS
two-year ranking, the vulnerabilities associated
with citizens’ online activities look set to continue
deepening hand in hand with societal and political
divisions. Taken as a whole, these developments
threaten to fundamentally undermine individuals’
trust in information and institutions.
Like last year, Misinformation and disinformation 
tops this year’s GRPS two-year ranking. The 
amount of false or misleading content to which 
societies are exposed continues to rise, as 
does the difficulty that citizens, companies and 
governments face in distinguishing it from true 
information. The interplay of rising Misinformation 
and disinformation with political and Societal 
polarization creates greater scope for algorithmic 
bias. If human, institutional and societal biases are 
not addressed, and/or best practices in modelling 
are neglected, the conditions will be ripe for 
algorithmic bias to become more prevalent. Such 
bias, whether inherent in data, models or their 
creators, can lead to unjust outcomes.
Despite the dangers related to false or misleading 
content, and the associated risks of algorithmic 
bias, citizens need to strike a balance between 
privacy on one hand and increased online 
personalization and convenience on the other 
hand. While data governance and regulation vary 
worldwide, it is becoming easier for citizens to 
be monitored, enabling governments, technology 
companies and threat actors to reach deeper 
into people’s lives. Those with access to rising 
computing power and the ability to leverage 
sophisticated AI/GenAI models could, if they 
choose to, exploit further the vulnerabilities provided 
by citizens’ online footprints. Rising political and 
Societal polarization could become more of a 
driving force for such increased surveillance.
Misinformation and 
disinformation in a polarized 
world
The advent of new technologies and the increase 
in user-generated content platforms is leading to a 
corresponding rise in the volume of content online. 
Flows of Misinformation and disinformation from 
those creating it are becoming more challenging to 
detect and remove in an increasingly fragmented 
media landscape.

false or misleading content – in the form of video,

images, voice or text – can be difficult. GenAI 
lowers the barriers for content production and 
distribution, and some of that content is inaccurate. 
Threat actors, state agencies in some countries,49 
activist groups, and individuals who may or 
may not have criminal intentions can automate 
and expand disinformation campaigns, greatly 
increasing their reach and impact.50 Misinformation 
and disinformation can also be the result of 
AI-hallucinated content or human error, and these 
too are likely to rise amid the growing volume of 
content.
The upshot is that it is becoming increasingly hard 
to know where to turn for true information. Both 
political and Societal polarization skew narratives 
and distort facts, contributing to low and declining 
trust in media.51 Across a sample of 47 countries, 
only 40% of respondents said that they trusted 
most news.52 
According to the EOS, respondents in high-income 
countries are generally more likely to express 
concern about the risk of Misinformation and 
disinformation over the next two years than 
respondents in lower-income countries, with some 
exceptions. This risk ranks among the top five in 13 
countries, including India, Germany and Canada, 
and features in the top 10 in 30 additional countries 
(Figure 1.23). Respondents identifying this risk 
often also highlight Societal polarization as one 
of the most severe risks in the same timeframe. 
Poor quality content and lack of trust in information 
sources continue to present a threat to societies.53
Algorithms, especially complex machine learning 
models, can also be an entry point for cyberattacks 
that use disinformation. An example of this would 
be a structured query language injection attack, in 
which inputs are manipulated to generate incorrect 
outcomes or to compromise training data sets.54 As 
many models lack transparency, either by intention, 
by accident, or because of intrinsic opacity, it 
is difficult to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate 
potential threats. In addition, given the reliance of 
algorithms on third-party data sources, software 
libraries and network infrastructures, threat actors 
can compromise the supply chain to manipulate 
algorithms and cause widespread damage. Further, 
as algorithms come to govern or influence more 
aspects of society, the potential for coordinated 
cyberattacks using automated systems grows.
Global Risks Report 2025

Algorithmic bias
Algorithmic bias can both be influenced by 
Misinformation and disinformation and can be 
a cause of it.55 The risks of algorithmic bias are 
heightened when the data used for training an 
AI model is itself a biased sample. Sometimes, 
the bias can be obvious. For example, in a hiring 
process, a set of bios used as examples of good 
candidates might be drawn from a pool of previous 
candidates, all of whom might have the same 
gender, race or nationality. Other times, a bias can 
be less obvious: for example, a model could be 
trained on citizens’ previous spending on education, 
without accounting for certain minority groups 
typically spending less on education. Synthetic data 
may be used, aiming to remove bias, but that can 
itself introduce new biases.56
Examples of biases against citizens include 
waiting times for a government appointment being 
assigned on the basis of a questionable set of input 
data and criteria, or automated responses failing 
to respond adequately to citizens’ needs. When 
algorithms are applied to sensitive decisions, biases 
in training data or assumptions made during model 
design can perpetuate or exacerbate inequities, 
further disenfranchising marginalized groups. 
Predictive policing is one area where algorithmic 
bias based on race can be a concern.57 Such risks 
are heightened further when there is no human 
participation in decision-making.
Unless there are clear accountability frameworks 
in place, the use of automated algorithms makes 
it challenging to assign responsibility when harmful 
or erroneous decisions are made, especially when 
AI is involved. Automated algorithms often operate 
as “black boxes”, making it difficult for individuals to 
understand how decisions are made. This lack of 
transparency and accountability can foster mistrust 
and skepticism about the fairness and accuracy of 
decisions taken.
In many cases, algorithmic bias can be the result 
of lack of knowledge, testing or sufficient oversight. 
How a model is developed, applied and governed 
is key to mitigating these risks. Independently of 
the input dataset used, the personal biases of 
individuals designing the assumptions of the model 
can also play a role in leading to unjust outcomes. 
These personal biases may be accidental (for 
example, the result of those inputting the data 
having insufficient technical expertise) or intentional, 
for example, to pursue political aims. 
One risk that could come into focus more over the 
next two years is algorithmic bias against people’s 
political identity.58 Algorithmic political bias might be 
used intentionally to, for example, affect recruitment 
into public-sector jobs or access to certain public 
services or financial services. What makes this risk 
especially dangerous is that individuals’ political 
biases are widely known, and those biases can 
easily find their way into algorithms or data sets. 
Furthermore, individuals’ political views can 
increasingly be determined, even against their will, 
from their online activities.59
Similarly to individual biases, societal biases can 
also play a role.60 These are likely to become more 
prevalent as societal divisions deepen. In the 
GRPS, Societal polarization is ranked #4 over a 
two-year time horizon. Regionally, Latin America 
and the Caribbean, Eastern Asia and Europe 
manifest the most pressing concerns over Societal 
polarization in the next two years, according to the 
EOS.

Defense and Intelligence sectors. More recently, a 
broader range of government services, including 
other sensitive domains such as taxation, 
environmental protection, and voter verification 
and registration, have also become increasingly 
technology-dependent.62 Governments now have 
unprecedented access to data on citizens – and 
technology companies often have even better 
access than the governments themselves do.63 As 
the computing power available to governments 
and technology companies continues to rise, it 
becomes easier for both entities to monitor citizens’ 
activities. 
When managed responsibly, analysis and 
processing of citizen data enables governments and 
the technology companies with whom they work to 
enhance public services. This can remain beneficial 
for citizens if effective legal guardrails are in place 
and both governments and technology providers 
act in ways that earn trust.64 However, without 
these conditions, the risks of misuse of surveillance 
capabilities rise.65
There is divergence worldwide around how 
governments can use the data that they can access, 
reflecting ideology and culture, as well as the 
technological capacity and resources available to 
each government. Regulations, such as the European 
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
also play a role, aiming to enhance personal data 
protection by placing stricter limits on data usage by 
governments and businesses. 
Meanwhile, citizens often remain unaware of 
how their personal data is collected, used and 
shared, limiting their ability to make informed 
decisions. Figure 1.24 shows the close connectivity 
between Censorship and surveillance, Societal 
polarization, Misinformation and disinformation 
and Online harms, highlighting the confluence of 
these risks in the digital ecosystem.
Censorship and surveillance ranks #16 in 
the GRPS risk ranking on a two-year outlook, 
increasing five positions since last year, showing 
that concern respondents have around this issue is 
real and growing. In a world of deepening societal 
and political divisions, amplified by eroding trust in 
the digital environment, concerns with Censorship 
and surveillance are most pronounced in Eastern 
Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and 
Central Asia, according to the EOS (Figure 1.25). 
Notably, Nicaragua ranks this risk as the fourth-
most severe threat over the next two years, while 
eight other economies identify it among their top 
15 risks.
Actions for today
A. Expand upskilling for people building and
using automated algorithms
Organizations should use AI models that minimize bias 
and mitigate unintended consequences in content 
creation and distribution. While technical solutions for 
significantly debiasing automated algorithms already 
exist, their consistent application remains a challenge. 
If implemented correctly, these solutions could greatly 
reduce the risks associated with model bias. Common 
debiasing strategies include data pre-processing 
before training a model, in-processing techniques 
during training, and post-processing steps after 
training.66 These methods help ensure that AI models 
are fairer and more equitable. 
However, due to the rapid pace of change in 
AI development and the increasing complexity 
of its applications, keeping up with the latest 
advancements in algorithmic debiasing is difficult 
for many involved in building and using automated 
algorithms. To address this, there is a pressing 
need for continuous upskilling of developers, data

scientists and policy-makers. Governments, civil 
society and academia should collaborate to create 
comprehensive training programmes that are 
frequent, regular, and reflect the latest advancements 
in AI and algorithmic fairness.67 These programmes 
should focus not only on technical skills but also 
emphasize the importance of ethical decision-
making, responsible data-handling, and the societal 
impact of AI systems.
B. Boost funding for digital literacy
The GRPS finds that Misinformation and 
disinformation and Societal polarization are 
the two risks for which Public awareness and 
education has the most long-term potential for 
driving action on risk reduction and preparedness 
(Figure 1.26). Censorship and surveillance is also 
within the top five risks that could be addressed in 
this way. There is an urgent need for comprehensive 
public awareness campaigns to educate citizens 
about the risks associated with digital spaces, as 
well as the tools and practices they can use to 
protect themselves and boost trust in their use 
of platforms. For example, citizens should be 
educated on privacy and security settings for their 
devices, including two-factor authentication, and 
app permissions. Awareness programmes should 
also cover recognizing phishing attempts, protecting 
personal data, and securely navigating social media. 
Additionally, digital literacy initiatives should help 
individuals understand the role of algorithms and 
data in shaping their online experiences, fostering 
critical thinking to identify and challenge biased 
or harmful content. Governments, civil society 
and private-sector organizations all have a role in 
promoting these campaigns, ensuring they are 
accessible to diverse populations.
C. Improve accountability and transparency
frameworks
The World Economic Forum’s Digital Trust 
Framework68 spells out key governance themes for 
ensuring AI’s sustainable and responsible adoption. 
They include accountability and transparency. 
The former could involve establishing supervisory 
boards and AI councils, as well as human oversight 
processes. These committees should consider 
diverse perspectives from technologists, ethicists, 
legal experts, creators and others to effectively 
assess GenAI products and features. They should 
be responsible for reviewing AI practices, identifying 
potential risks and ensuring compliance with both 
internal policies and external regulations.
Regarding transparency, nurturing consumers’ 
trust requires organizations to inform about AI-
generated content and its use through appropriate 
labelling and disclosures. Information on related 
data practices, safety policies and potential risks 
(such as bias and privacy) of the AI model used 
in GenAI products should be made available via 
accessible documentation. Standards and technical 
solutions to ensure content authenticity – such as 
digital watermarking, content origin and history, and 
blockchain-based rights management – are currently 
under development to support a trustworthy 
information ecosystem. However, successful 
adoption at scale requires policy frameworks that 
are aligned with common principles, rules and 
technological standards.

Global Risks 2035: 
The point of no return
2
The world in 2035
2.1
The current and short-term risks landscape 
described in Chapter 1 may be exacerbated in 
terms of severity as the world moves towards 2035 
– unless we collectively act on such foresight today 
and work collaboratively across all stakeholder 
groups towards a more promising future. This 
chapter focuses on the longer-term horizon, 
outlining survey results for the likely impact of 
risks in the next 10 years and providing in-depth 
assessments of three risk themes – pollution, 
biotech and super-ageing societies. The chapter 
concludes with a retrospective analysis of findings 
from the last two decades of Global Risks Reports.  
The GRPS suggests that the road to 2035 will be 
challenging to navigate. Respondents are far less 
optimistic about the outlook for the world over the 
longer term than the short term. As noted in the 
Key findings section, 62% of respondents to the 
GRPS predict a turbulent or stormy outlook over the 
next 10 years (Chapter 1, Figure A).
Comparing the two- and 10-year timeframes in 
more detail reveals a markedly deteriorating global 
risks landscape. All 33 risks surveyed increase in 
severity score over the long term compared to the 
short term, reflecting respondents’ concerns about

the heightened frequency or intensity of these risks 
over the course of the 10-year horizon (Figure 2.1). 
Environmental and, to a lesser degree, technological 
risks dominate the long-term global risks landscape 
according to the GRPS. In fact, nearly all 
environmental risks are included in the top 10 (Figure 
2.2). Extreme weather events are anticipated to 
become even more severe, with the risk ranked first 
over the next decade for the second year running. 
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse ranks #2, 
up from #3 last year and with a significant deterioration 
compared to its two-year ranking (#21). Critical 
change to Earth systems at #3, Natural resource 
shortages at #4 and Pollution at #10 complete the 
very bleak outlook for environmental risks.
Technological risks fare little better than 
environmental risks over the next 10 years. Adverse 
outcomes of AI technologies follows Biodiversity 
loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the risks 
expected to increase in severity the most from the 
two-year to the 10-year timeframe, ranking #6 on 
the 10-year risk outlook compared to #31 on the 
two-year risk outlook. 
Societal risks round out the top 10 on the 10-year 
horizon. Inequality (wealth, income) stands at #7, 
followed by Societal polarization at #8. This is an 
important pair of risks to watch, given how related 
they can be to bouts of social instability, and to 
both domestic political and geostrategic instability.

Korea, Italy or Germany, unfavourable demographic 
trends could accentuate these societal risks over 
the next 10 years. Pensions crises and labour 
shortages in the long-term care sector are likely 
to become acute problems, with no easy fix 
for governments. Section 2.5, Super-ageing 
societies explores this risk theme. 
Economic risks fall mostly in the bottom half of the 
10-year risk ranking and have remained relatively 
stable compared to last year’s survey. But as 
Section 2.6, Looking back: 20 years of the 
Global Risks Report shows, economic risks tend 
to be volatile over time – meaning that an economic 
crisis should not be ruled out over the next 10 
years. One significant area of concern is Crime and 
illicit economic opportunity, which has increased 
16 positions year-on-year to #15 in the 10-year 
ranking. 
Geopolitical risks, despite topping the immediate-
term ranking and featuring among the top 10 in the 
short-term ranking are noticeably absent from the 
top 10 rankings when it comes to the outlook for 
the next decade. Nonetheless, State-based armed 
conflict has increased from #15 last year to #12, 
and there has been an uptick in the Biological, 
chemical or nuclear weapons risk by seven 
positions to #19. State-based armed conflict 
remains a long-term concern for respondents from 
the Middle East and Northern Africa in particular; 
this is the only region with a geopolitical risk in the 
top five (Figure 2.3).
The overall 10-year risk outlook has remained 
relatively stable compared to last year’s Global 
Risks Report, suggesting that little has been 
achieved when it comes to risk mitigation or 
solutions. Extreme weather events (#1), Natural 
resource shortages (#4), Misinformation and 
disinformation (#5), Adverse outcomes of AI 
(#6) and Pollution (#10) rank identically compared 
to last year’s edition. However, when it comes 
to Pollution, it is noticeable that younger survey 
respondents are especially concerned, with the 
under 30s age group ranking it at #3. There is 
also divergence across stakeholder groups in how 
Pollution is ranked, with government respondents, 
Global Risks Report 2025

civil society and academia placing Pollution 
as a top 10 risk, but not the private sector or 
international organizations (Figure 2.4).
Section 2.3, Pollution at a crossroads explores 
under-appreciated pollutant risks that are likely to 
become more top of mind by 2035, given their 
significant impacts on health and ecosystems. 
Unless concrete action is taken today to address 
polluting activities, these impacts will only worsen.  
Looking further down the 10-year risk ranking 
(Chapter 1, Figure G), many positions have 
remained stable year-on-year, including 
Concentration of strategic resources and 
technologies (#13), Censorship and surveillance 
(#14), Asset bubble bursts (#30), Inflation (#32) 
and Non-weather related natural disasters (#33) 
as the lowest-ranked risk. Adverse outcomes of 
frontier technologies (#23) has also remained 
relatively stable, increasing just one position since 
last year’s report. The risks that have seen the 
biggest falls in their 10-year ranking compared 
to last year’s report are Intrastate violence, down 
seven positions to #29 and Decline in health and 
well-being, down eight positions to #28. 
The latter three risks – Adverse outcomes of 
frontier technologies, Intrastate violence, and 
Decline in health and well-being – are all related 
to Section 2.4, Losing control of biotech?, which 
provides an in-depth analysis of risks in the sector. 
Advances in biotech are leading to increasingly fast 
progress in medicine and explain, perhaps, some 
of the increased optimism regarding the Decline 
in health and well-being risk. But this progress 
comes alongside new low-probability, but high-
impact risks. These include interstate or Intrastate 
violence from biological terrorism, and Adverse 
outcomes of frontier technologies involving 
accidental or malicious misuse of gene editing 
technologies or of brain-computer interfaces.

Structural forces
2.2
In last year’s Global Risks Report, we introduced 
the concept of Structural forces into our analysis 
of global risks. Four spheres – technological, 
geostrategic, climatic and demographic – continue 
to form the backdrop to the global risks that will 
play out over the next decade and beyond.
We define these Structural forces as the long-
term shifts in the arrangement of, and relationships 
between, the systemic elements of the global 
landscape. These forces have the potential to 
materially impact the speed, spread or scope of 
global risks, and will in turn be influenced by each 
other. We are continuing to witness how these 
structural forces are converging, accelerating and 
creating instability in societies, economies and 
institutions. If left unaddressed, they could steer 
our world toward an increasingly fractured and 
unsustainable path. 
The four Structural forces are summarized in 
Box 2.1. They are Technological acceleration; 
Geostrategic shifts; Climate change; and 
Demographic bifurcation. While all four forces 
have global ramifications, some, such as climate 
change, are more multi-directional in their 
development, which could allow for several potential 
futures. Similarly, while all represent longer-term 
shifts to the structural landscape, some have the 
potential to manifest more quickly due to underlying 
variables. Geostrategic shifts, for example, may 
lead to further divergence between leading powers, 
while technological acceleration can foster new 
discoveries that transform systems rapidly. As the 
results of the GRPS show, the Structural forces’ 
influence on the global risks landscape is well 
underway.
Structural forces
B O X  2 . 1
Technological acceleration relates to development 
pathways of emerging technologies and the expected 
significant developments over the next 10 years. 
Section 1.5: Technology and polarization analyses 
risks associated with citizens’ rising digital footprints 
in the context of Societal polarization, while Section 
2.4: Losing control of biotech? explores the risks 
associated with accelerating progress in biotech.
Climate change encompasses the range of possible 
trajectories of global warming and consequences to 
Earth systems. As a Structural force, climate change 
is closely related to trends in pollution: Unsustainable 
patterns of production and consumption are driving 
increasing pollution of air, water and land, with the 
nature and scale of impacts on health and ecosystems 
still coming to light. This is explored in Section 2.3: 
Pollution at a crossroads.
Geostrategic shifts refers to evolving sources and 
concentration of geopolitical power. This, in turn, 
influences the global order, impacting alliances and 
their dynamics, as well as the offensive and defensive 
projection of soft and hard power. The ongoing loss 
of support for current multilateral institutions, and its 
impacts for global stability and humanitarian needs, is 
explored in Section 1.3: “Geopolitical recession”, 
while Section 1.4: Supercharged economic tensions 
focuses on the risks of global trade fragmenting. 
Demographic bifurcation refers to changes in the 
size, growth and structure of populations around 
the world. While some countries are super-ageing 
societies, with over 20% of their populations aged 
over 65 years old, others have far younger population

Pollution at a crossroads
2.3
	–
Short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon and methane are accelerating the pace of climate 
change.
	–
Freshwater and ocean pollution are severely impacting human and ecosystem health, with antimicrobial 
pollution emerging as an increasing concern. 
	–
Nitrogen and waste pollution are becoming more costly, generating a range of health and ecosystem 
impacts.
Pollution ranks #10 in the GRPS 10-year risk 
ranking, with 23% of respondents expressing 
maximal concern (Figure 2.5). Moreover, it is 
noticeable that younger survey respondents are 
especially alarmed, with the under 30s age group 
ranking it at #3 in the 10-year risk ranking.
In 2024, six of the nine “planetary boundaries” 
for environmental health were crossed, with a 
seventh boundary in jeopardy.1 These boundaries 
contribute to the stability of the world’s life-
support system, including our economies and 
societies. Unsustainable patterns of production and 
consumption are driving climate change, Pollution, 
and biodiversity loss, referred to by the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) as the Triple Planetary Crisis.2 Pollution 
is the world’s largest environmental risk factor for 
disease and premature deaths,3 and its impacts 
are unequal, with 92% of Pollution-related deaths 
and the greatest burden of related economic losses 
occurring in low- and middle-income countries.4 
Pollution poses greater risks in specific 
geographies and disproportionately affects 
vulnerable groups of the population that are 
exposed to higher levels of Pollution. Marginalized 
communities, urban areas and industrial zones 
bear the large brunt of its impacts due to proximity 
to sources of emissions, including waste disposal 
sites, and often limited green spaces. These 
disparities create further inequities in healthcare 
access and burden, as well as in economic costs.  
By 2035, the compounded effects of Pollution 
threaten to erode ecosystem resilience, diminishing 
its ability to sustain life and deliver essential 
services. Decline in health and well-being 
(Figure 2.6) is increasingly associated with pollutant 
exposure, including the rising incidences of 
cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, 
infertility rates and cancer.5 
Anthropogenic activities are key drivers of all 
types of Pollution. These activities are expected 
to increase further over the next decade unless a 
different course of action is taken. Some polluting 
activities and pollutants are addressed under 
climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, including 
the drive towards net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. However, there is a concerning common 
denominator of many countries’ green transition 
pathways: explicit, comprehensive plans for tackling 
the mounting health and ecosystem impacts of 
Pollution are missing.
Economies globally are at different stages of the 
green transition. In the EOS, executives were asked

to identify the top five risks most likely to pose the 
biggest threat to their respective country in the next 
two years. While Pollution (air, water, soil) ranks 
#18 of the 34 global risks, it emerges as the #1 
concern in Central Asia and as a leading concern in 
Southern Asia (#6) and among lower-middle income 
economies (#11). At the country level, Pollution 
ranks among the top three risks in 10 countries, 
including Malta, Azerbaijan, Ghana, and Kosovo. 
Particularly in densely populated countries such 
as Bangladesh (#3) and India (#4), Pollution has 
become one of the most critical challenges to tackle 
(Figure 2.7).
A Pollution-conscious green transition is needed. 
Some of the pollutants that must be accounted for 
in that transition are newer or emerging, not well 
understood, or do not yet have enough evidence 
of their potential impacts. Different pollutants 
tend to come under the regulatory spotlight only 
as our awareness of their profound long-term 
impacts on health and ecosystems grows. Better 
understanding these pollutants and their impacts 
is a first step towards both targeted policies and 
adaptive strategies. The pollutants can be analysed 
within the lenses of air, water and land - even 
though, once introduced, they do not remain 
confined to a single environmental domain but 
create complex, interdependent impacts.
“Super pollutants” in the air 
Air pollutants include particulate matter (PM), 
ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon 
monoxide. Exposure to air pollutants is a particularly 
severe health risk for vulnerable populations, 
including children, pregnant women, people with 
pre-existing or chronic health conditions, and the 
elderly.6 Air Pollution also significantly reduces 
work productivity, leading to increased sick 
days and commensurate economic losses.7 Like 
Pollution overall, air Pollution impacts societies 
unequally, with people in lower and middle-income 
countries exposed to higher risks.8 In 2024, people 
in the most polluted areas of the world were found 
to be breathing air at least six times more polluted 
than those in the least polluted areas.9
Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), known 
as “super pollutants”, are a group of pollutants 
that remain in the atmosphere for a relatively 
short period of time in comparison to longer-
lived GHGs.10 However, these pollutants have a 
disproportionately higher impact on air quality 
and global warming. SLCPs include mainly black 
carbon, methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and 
tropospheric ozone. They are responsible for up to 
45% of near-term global warming.11 Speed is crucial 
for incorporating SLCP reductions into a Pollution-
conscious green transition. 
Black carbon
Black carbon, more commonly known as soot, is 
a SLCP that consists of tiny black particles that 
can be carried for thousands of kilometres. It is 
a component of PM, specifically PM2.5, which is 
formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. 
Its particles can penetrate the bloodstream through 
the alveoli in lungs to transport toxic compounds 
around the body.12 PM2.5 has been linked to a 
wide range of health implications, including chronic

respiratory conditions, strokes, heart attacks and 
cancer, as well as to early childhood development 
issues and long-term effects on cognition and 
health.13 The particles of black carbon also 
affect the ecosystem by increasing plant surface 
temperature, interfering with rainfall and diminishing 
sunlight, which has a significant effect on crop 
losses each year.14
Black carbon contributes to accelerating the 
melting of ice and snow in polar and mountainous 
areas. Tackling black carbon is a “win-win” for both 
air Pollution and climate, as it is a particle that is up 
to 1,500 times stronger than carbon dioxide (CO2) 
per unit of mass.15 While atmospheric warming is 
an emerging area of research on black carbon, any 
efforts to tackle the reduction of black carbon offer 
a quicker solution when combined with ongoing 
reduction of CO2.
Sources of black carbon vary from region to 
region and include sectors such as energy use 
(commercial and residential), industrial production, 
agricultural burning, combustion-powered 
cookstoves, and forest wildfires. Addressing 
black carbon emissions has the potential to slow 
the rate of warming of the climate by up to 50% 
worldwide and up to two-thirds in the Arctic,16 and 
can be achieved through cost-effective, affordable 
measures.17
Methane
Methane is a powerful SLCP with a warming 
potential over 80 times that of CO2 over a 20-
year period, which makes it a major contributor to 
climate change.18 The main sources of methane 
emissions include fossil fuels, agriculture and waste. 
Methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime 
of approximately 12 years, which means that 
efforts to reduce methane can yield relatively rapid 
climate benefits.19 It is a major precursor to ground-
level ozone, an air pollutant that poses health 
risks, decreases agricultural yields, and stresses 
ecosystems.20 
Failure to reduce methane emissions is recognized 
as one of the most significant short-term risks 
for limiting near-term global temperature rise.21 
The Global Methane Pledge (GMP), supported by 
159 countries, has set an ambitious target to cut 
global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 from 
2020 levels.22 Meeting the GMP has the potential 
to reduce warming by at least 0.2 °C by 2050 and

annually prevent 26 million tons of crop losses, 
255,000 premature deaths, 775 thousand asthma-
related hospitalizations and 73 billion hours of lost 
labour due to extreme heat.23
Water pollutants
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also 
known as “forever chemicals” are used in consumer 
products to make them water, grease or stain 
resistant. They are useful in many industries, and 
are now being detected in our drinking water, 
soil, air and food. They pose a significant threat to 
people’s health, as they do not easily break down, 
and are toxic at extremely low levels.24 Exposure to 
certain levels of PFAS can lead to significant health 
impacts, including decreased fertility in women, 
developmental delays in children, increased risk 
of certain cancers and reduced ability of the body 
to fight infections.25 Governments are increasingly 
showing concern over the impacts of PFAS 
Pollution, and regulations are emerging to limit 
human exposure.
Micro- and nanoplastics 
The world is currently producing more than 
430 million tonnes of plastic annually.26 Each 
year, 19 million tonnes of plastic waste leak into 
the environment – 13 million onto land and six 
million into rivers and coastlines. Plastic does not 
biodegrade,27 and over 99% of plastic is directly 
derived from fossil fuels.28 Plastic Pollution in
aquatic environments includes Pollution from 
shipping and fishing.29
Microplastics – pieces of plastic of less 
than five millimetres wide – include plastics 
originally manufactured to be that size (‘primary 
microplastics’), for example microbeads, industrial 
plastic powders and pellets, but also pieces of 
plastic that have resulted from the degradation 
and fragmentation of larger items, for example 
plastic bottles, synthetic textiles and tyres. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) concludes that 
although further work is required to understand the 
impacts of microplastics on human and biodiversity 
health,30 their presence has been detected both in 
our bodies and in the air, causing rising concern. 
Microplastics also affect the soil ecosystem and 
restrict the growth of plants,31 both in marine and 
freshwater settings. Nanoplastics – pieces of plastic 
even smaller than microplastics at 100-1,000 
nanometers wide – are an emerging area of high 
risk, as there is an increased chance of them being 
ingested, inhaled or absorbed. 
Chemicals present in plastics are endocrine 
disrupting, interfering with hormone actions in the 
body. These chemicals can be released during the 
entire life cycle, with more than 13,000 chemical 
substances identified.32 This is an area of emerging 
research and concern given that endocrine-
disrupting chemicals are linked to significant health 
effects including infertility, obesity, cancer, thyroid 
problems and developmental issues.33
Pharmaceuticals 
Pharmaceutical Pollution falls into the category of 
“contaminants of emerging concern”,34 alongside 
personal care products, sunscreen, insect 
repellents and detergents, which all tend to be 
long-lived and therefore accumulate at low levels 
over long periods of time in the environment. While 
pharmaceuticals have been well-established as 
water pollutants for decades, it is only recently that 
the extent and nature of that Pollution is starting 
to be assessed.35 This is currently an unregulated 
category of pollutants.
Antimicrobial resistance in both people and animals 
is in part associated with antimicrobials entering 
water bodies, along with overuse and misuse of 
antimicrobials. Antimicrobials are medicines that 
are used to treat infections in people, animals and 
plants and include a range of antibiotics, antivirals, 
antifungals and antiparasitics.36 Antimicrobials, 
when released into water from manufacturing 
waste, healthcare facilities, farming, and directly 
from consumers (both people and animals), can 
remain in the environment. Globally, there is 
insufficient awareness of and incentives among 
manufacturers and users of antimicrobials for 
sparing usage and correct disposal. The WHO 
issued guidelines on antimicrobial Pollution from 
medicines manufacturing in September 2024, 
aimed at providing a basis for better practices and 
regulation.37

Nitrogen and waste disposal 
Nitrogen
Industrial agriculture has long been dependent 
on nitrogenous fertilizers to increase productivity. 
This has resulted in nitrogen Pollution becoming 
a major contaminant of soil, water and air. A key 
part of the problem is that the more these fertilizers 
are used to increase crop yields, the more is lost 
to the environment, escaping into water and the 
atmosphere, the latter as ammonia.
If groundwater becomes contaminated with 
nitrogen it can become a health issue. For example, 
high nitrate levels in drinking water can cause 
reproductive problems, methemoglobinemia, 
colorectal cancer, thyroid disease and neural 
tube defects.38 Nitrogen in rivers flows into the 
sea causing eutrophication of coastal waters, a 
phenomenon generating various seawater health 
issues. Recent evidence shows that eutrophication 
is a problem that is on a worsening trend.39 
Livestock manure and fertilizers in agriculture are 
responsible for 81% of ammonia emissions into the 
air globally. That contributes to 50% (in the EU) and 
30% (in the United States) of PM2.5 air Pollution, 
causing chronic illnesses that can lead to premature 
mortality.40 Livestock manure and fertilizer use also 
leads to nitrous oxide production, a potent GHG, 
and the most important substance for the depletion 
of the stratospheric ozone layer, with implications 
for the increased occurrence of skin cancer. 
Waste disposal
Waste can be categorized by origin (e.g. municipal 
solid waste or industrial waste), character (e.g. 
hazardous waste or organic waste) or type (e.g. 
e-waste or healthcare waste). Improper waste 
disposal can lead to the spread of infectious 
diseases, the release of methane, and exposure to 
Pollution from chemicals released through landfills, 
organic waste, and burning of waste. For example, 
exposure to improperly managed e-waste and its 
components can release a wide range of different 
chemical particles into the environment, which can 
have multiple adverse health and developmental 
impacts, especially in young children and pregnant 
women. 
Without urgent action on waste management, 
by 2050 its global annual cost – factoring in both 
the direct cost and the hidden costs of Pollution, 
ill health and climate change from poor waste 
disposal practices – could almost double from $361 
billion to $640 billion.41
Actions for today 
A. Improve monitoring, reporting and evaluation 
systems  
For many emerging pollutants, such as 
nanoplastics, there is a lack of reliable data 
on health risks including reproductive and 
developmental toxicity and longer-term effects 
of low-level exposures. The GRPS finds that 
the approach with the third-highest potential for 
driving action on risk reduction and preparedness 
regarding Pollution over the next 10 years is 
Research and development (Figure 2.8). However, 
a lack of real-time data or a unified system for 
reporting, both nationally and internationally for 
many pollutants makes it difficult to measure, 
monitor and act. There must be an improvement

of the current monitoring, reporting and evaluation 
(MRE) systems to identify and understand emerging 
risks of pollutants and track progress over time. 
By improving existing MRE systems and sharing 
protocols, stakeholders can inform policy decisions, 
enhance transparency on pollutants and increase 
targeted interventions on Pollution sources and 
their impacts. 
B. Strengthen regulatory frameworks  
To mitigate the health and ecosystem impacts of 
pollutants, more holistic and pre-emptive regulatory 
action is needed. Actions taken today can reduce 
the impacts of Pollution to 2035. According 
to a report by UNEP, approximately one-third 
of countries worldwide lack legally mandated 
standards for outdoor air quality.42 A Pollution-
conscious future requires building upon and 
strengthening regulatory frameworks to include 
and address well-established pollutants, but also 
new and emerging challenges. National and local 
regulations is identified by GRPS respondents 
as the approach with the most potential for 
driving action on risk reduction and preparedness 
regarding Pollution over the next 10 years (Figure 
2.8). Effective regulation requires adaptive policies 
informed by ongoing scientific research.
C. Unlock ambitious funding 
Chronic underfunding of initiatives on Pollution 
persists. For example, less than 1% of all 
international development funding ($17.3 billion) 
was expressly committed to targeting outdoor 
air Pollution between 2015 and 2021.43 Large-
scale, integrated and private-public-philanthropic 
collaborative action on funding is required for 
Pollution prevention at local, national and 
international scale. Innovative funding mechanisms 
will be required to address the transboundary 
nature of Pollution. For example, international 
financial institutions and multilateral development 
banks can further support Pollution mitigation 
efforts by providing concessional loans or grants. 
One specific area requiring more funding is 
technological solutions. Many existing technologies 
make certain types of Pollution mitigation not 
only feasible, but economically advantageous by 
creating healthier environments and improving 
human health. Examples include improving waste 
management with advanced filtration systems and 
proper segregation at source, and methane capture 
technologies. Deploying current technologies 
widely and immediately, while continuously refining 
approaches as data improves, sets the foundation 
for a healthier, sustainable and resilient future. 
Governments can incentivize the integration of 
such technologies into industrial practices. Public-
private collaboration in this area to unlock ambitious 
funding can help turn Pollution challenges into 
opportunities.

	–
It is becoming easier for threat actors to make use of advances in biotech to modify or create new 
biological agents, which if released could lead to pandemics or be used in targeted biological attacks.
	–
While biotech is offering groundbreaking solutions for health issues, these can come with new risks, 
from possible clinical complications to unknown long-term impacts.
	–
Unless comprehensive global ethical boundaries are set for biotech developments, then ethical 
concerns are likely to be disregarded by some, leading to new sources of division and conflict within 
societies.
Losing control of biotech?
2.4
Adverse outcomes of frontier technologies, 
including biotech, is one of the risks with the 
sharpest rise in GRPS ranking between the two-
year and 10-year time horizons, by ten positions 
to #23. This divergence shows that, while global 
risks stemming from the field of biotech are not top 
of mind today, they will become more so within 
a decade. There are three sets of risks in biotech 
that need to be watched closely over the coming 
years: Rising accessibility of bioweapons; negative 
health impacts as the flipside of efforts to cure or 
prevent health issues; and the potential for those 
with access to leading-edge biotech to cross ethical 
boundaries. 
In each of these three areas, the first warning 
signs are already emerging. Risks will grow over 
time and become more complex as further rapid 
technological progress is made. Advances in 
biotech are being supercharged by convergent 
technologies such as AI and machine learning 
approaches, streamlining the ability of both 
legitimate researchers and threat actors to make 
sense of large datasets.
Regional and national responses in the EOS reveal 
pockets of heightened concern around Adverse 
outcomes of frontier technologies, including 
biotech. Several nations, such as Qatar, Iran, Saudi 
Arabia, Switzerland and Demark, assign this risk 
relatively high significance, reflecting their unique 
geopolitical or economic priorities. High-income 
regions exhibit moderate concern overall, whereas 
emerging economies have lower short-term 
rankings for this risk but may face rising exposure 
as technology adoption accelerates (Figure 2.10).
These risks come alongside tremendous new 
opportunities for breakthrough improvements 
not only in health, but also well-being, as well 
as agriculture, the development of new building 
materials, mining and many other areas.44 Within 
a decade, products made using synthetic biology 
will permeate our societies much more than 
today,45 and the tech-driven bioeconomy will play 
an increasingly important role in climate-change 
mitigation.46 The scope of opportunities related to 
human genome editing, specifically, accelerated 
following the award in 2020 of the Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry to Emmanuelle Charpentier and 
Jennifer Doudna for their development of Clustered 
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - 
associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9), a technology 
that allows for precise cuts in DNA to modify

genetic code. Genome editing technologies, 
including CRISPR-Cas9, have already been used 
to treat gene-related diseases such as sickle cell 
disease and haemophilia, among others. There 
has also, for example, been recent success in 
treating an inherited condition that causes vision 
loss in childhood.47 Gene editing technologies are 
also used in some areas of research into cancer48 
and viruses such as HIV,49 and there is hope that 
CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to counter antibiotic 
resistance. Overall, some 2,000 gene therapies are 
under development worldwide.50 Many of these will 
become available within a decade, representing 
previously unthinkable progress. Eventually, gene 
therapies may become seen as an obvious choice 
to protect against disease, as vaccinations are 
today.
Significant progress is taking place in another 
promising field: brain-computer interfaces. The first 
people suffering from quadriplegia have received 
brain implants connecting their neural signals to 
digital devices.51 Further, alternative technology (in 
several cases with sensors attached to the outside 
of the head and neck) is being applied to facilitate 
communication between the brain and artificial 
limbs, benefiting, for example, war veterans or 
people with motor neurone disease.52
Broadening bioweapons threat 
Risk perceptions around Adverse outcomes of 
frontier technologies are likely in part to reflect 
the fear that militaries and terrorists will continue to 
pursue new uses of biotech as more potent and 
stealth forms of weaponry. Attaining and building out 
biotech leadership is likely to rise up the agendas 
of leading militaries. Over the next decade, biotech-
based weapons could also become increasingly 
integrated with other (non-biological) weaponry. 
Cyber espionage and warfare, and Biological, 
chemical or nuclear weapons and hazards used in 
combination have far greater, compounding impacts 
than when used on their own.
Advances in AI-driven biotech will make biological 
weapons easier and cheaper to develop over the 
next decade.53 The weapons themselves could 
be made more harmful than previous versions.54 
Or, they could be different to those previously 
built in that they might eventually be focused on 
specific target groups of people based on genetic 
characteristics, leaving other people unharmed. 
Over the next decade there is also a risk that 
non-state actors could develop such weapons,

increasing the severity of future terrorist attacks. 
One area of particular concern is dual use of AI 
models: In a laboratory experiment reported in 
2022, an AI system that had previously been used 
for medicinal drug discovery was trained to find 
and combine toxicity molecules. Within only six 
hours, 40,000 compounds at least as toxic as 
the sample nerve agent had been generated.55 
Theoretically, there is an unlimited number of new 
toxic substances that could be created using 
such models.56 The researchers involved in the 
experiment emphasized that the computing power 
and software required for such experiments is easily 
attainable today.57 
Experts are also warning about the relative ease 
with which viruses capable of infecting humans, 
such as monkeypox or smallpox, could be 
enhanced to evade human immune systems, 
making standard vaccines ineffective. With the 
tools and information required to alter a pathogen’s 
genetic code becoming easier to access, it may 
only be a matter of time before a threat actor 
releases a virus that causes the next pandemic.58 
As the costs of setting up a laboratory and 
purchasing the necessary equipment are relatively 
limited, the main barrier to threat actors misusing 
advances in biotech is having the scientific expertise 
itself – a barrier that will be far from insurmountable 
over the next decade. Of course, it will also take 
considerable (and unrelated) expertise to translate 
the creation of new toxic substances into the 
building of weaponry, given the complexities of 
transporting and disseminating the substances 
created. But unlike in the nuclear sector, where 
strict protocols and monitoring of materials and 
equipment make proliferation efforts relatively easy 
for governments to detect, this set of conditions 
is not present in the same way when it comes to 
weaponizing biotech.
Biotech can also provide a bridge from the biological 
world to the cyber realm. As far back as 2017, 
researchers in the United States demonstrated 
that it was possible to hack a computer using DNA 
sequence data. Under certain preconditions, they 
were able to introduce malware into DNA purchased 
online (at minimal cost), which was read and then 
processed by a computer that in turn became 
compromised by the malware.59 Looking ahead 
a decade, as Cyber espionage and warfare 
becomes more sophisticated and more people 
become acquainted with biotech developments, it 
is conceivable that the researchers’ warning – that 
hackers could use the DNA sequences from faked 
blood samples to gain access to hack computers 
– could come true.60 Indeed, GRPS respondents
express concern with the risk interconnection
between Adverse outcomes of frontier
technologies and Cyber espionage and warfare,
as shown in Figure 2.11 below.

Opaque health concerns
Beyond modifying biological agents and creating 
new ones for bioweaponry and terrorism, over 
the coming years there will be other opportunities 
to misuse – accidentally or on purpose – 
technologies for editing DNA and applying that 
to human cells (as well as animals, plants and 
ecosystems). Part of the trouble with human 
genome editing technology is that it is too new to 
predict its long-term effects on both the individuals 
being treated and future generations. 
Problems can arise at the time an individual 
is receiving gene editing therapy. These may 
involve a range of clinical complications61 or 
off-target effects (which are very common for 
CRISPR-Cas9). In some gene editing processes, 
an individual’s genome is subject to significant 
rearrangements, which have the potential to 
generate other health issues, such as cancer 
or even new genetic diseases that are not yet 
understood by scientists and doctors.
In 2018, twins with the genomes of their embryos 
edited to be resistant to HIV were born in China. 
The case remains unique in the world – as far as is 
publicly known – and caused ethical controversy 
at the time. The twins were guaranteed anonymity 
by the Chinese government and so there has 
not been any publicly available tracking of their 
subsequent health status. The case demonstrates 
the reach of the technology, and other such 
surprise announcements by state or non-state 
actors cannot be excluded over the next decade. 
Although it may still be generally perceived to 
be a low-probability risk today, there only needs 
to be one instance of nefarious application of 
human genome editing (possibly in an unregulated 
or non-professional environment) for serious 
consequences to result, perhaps involving loss of 
control with cascading health impacts.
Other areas of biotech present health risks that 
are also still somewhat opaque. For now, the risks 
associated with brain-computer interfaces appear 
distant, but this could change over 10 years. One 
category of risks is of a clinical nature, involving 
possible damage to the brain if the medical 
intervention is not carried out correctly or in case 
of complications. A growing number of individual 
biohackers are already implanting various small 
devices in different parts of their bodies, some of 
which they intend to link to the internet. These 
operations are often undertaken at considerable 
risk to themselves. If this trend catches on, it could 
lead not only to unforeseen medical complications 
for some of the individuals involved, but ultimately 
also to a world in which person-to-person 
connections start being replaced by permanent 
person-machine connectivity, partially divorced 
from physical reality. The COVID-19 pandemic 
highlighted the devastating impact of lessening 
face-to-face interaction; developments such as 
this have the potential to magnify that.
Crossing ethical boundaries
The wide variety of applications of genome 
editing, from enhancing health or performance to 
editing foetuses, leads to difficult ethical questions 
around where the use of these technologies 
should stop. For example, would it be ethical to 
apply gene editing to change a child’s eye or skin 
colour, to modify height or, if that were to become 
possible, to increase intelligence? What might be 
unintended consequences, in current or future 
generations, of editing genes and entire genomes 
in these ways?

Global Risks Report 2025
57
The societal consequences also bear 
consideration. There is a risk of a future world in 
which a select global few have access to and use 
human genome editing technology to become 
stronger, healthier and happier, with the rest of the 
population – which over a 10-year timeframe is still 
likely to be the vast majority – unable to afford it. 
Gene therapy treatment, such as CAR-T therapy 
(an immunotherapy for cancer) for one person 
can easily cost half a million dollars or more for 
the therapy alone.62 The limited access to such 
technologies is likely to represent another source 
of Inequality, exacerbating Societal polarization 
and political tensions. 
Inequality and ethical considerations will 
increasingly also play out among countries. The 
concentration of biotech innovation among a few 
dominant biotech companies and countries could 
result in limited access to everyone else. This 
could leave low-income economies vulnerable 
due to limited awareness and expertise. The 
interconnection between Adverse outcomes of 
frontier technologies and the Concentration of 
strategic resources and technologies, observed 
in the EOS, highlights this risk.
The push for rapid progress will also increasingly 
test ethical boundaries in the domain of brain-
computer interfaces. As more people opt for 
having a brain-computer interface, the time 
is likely to come over the next decade when 
demand will arise for the technology from those 
who are interested in enhancing the performance 
of their brains, potentially augmenting their own 
knowledge or productivity with an AI “add on”. At 
some point in this chain of developments, serious 
risks will emerge. The digital device to which the 
individual is connected may be able to “read” the 
thoughts of the individual, compromising privacy. 
This could represent a substantive form of control 
over the individual by whoever is managing the 
connected device and its online content, whether 
that controller is an organization or the state. 
The individual might only be able to reverse the 
situation by having the implant removed.
Actions for today 
All stakeholders should act today to safeguard 
human development and ecosystems over the 
coming decade and beyond, allowing the benefits 
of biotech to be reaped while limiting the scope for 
adverse impacts. Specific areas to focus on are: 
A. Build a global set of norms
The pace of change in the sector is so fast that 
regulators globally struggle to keep up. Rising 
geopolitical tensions suggest that the political will 
for a comprehensive cross-border agreement on 
acceptable uses of biotech is unlikely to be present 
for some time, posing an ongoing challenge. But 
ultimately, intergovernmental agreements will be 
required to keep biotech risks under control. If 
one or more countries deviate from ethical and 
technical protocols, there is every chance that 
malicious or accidental developments in biotech 
will quickly become a problem for other countries, 
as well. As part of such a new framework, a global 
ethical oversight body should be established, 
consisting of individuals respected worldwide for 
their humanity and ethical positions, as well as 
top minds on biotech itself who are able to keep 
abreast of cutting-edge Research & development 
and help to direct government efforts in this

regard. Research & development was listed 
by GRPS respondents as the top approach for 
mitigating risks from Adverse outcomes of frontier 
technologies (Figure 2.12). 
Pending such an intergovernmental agreement, 
which could take years, a less ambitious objective 
for the short term would be to establish and agree 
on a set of broad norms to guide government 
policies on biotech worldwide. Leading bioethics 
experts have emphasized the importance of 
broad-based dialogue across societies63 to help 
establish such norms. Regarding human genome 
editing specifically, progress has already been 
made in this regard: the WHO in 2019 established 
an expert advisory committee to examine the 
scientific, ethical, social and legal challenges 
associated with it.64 The committee in 2021 
published a framework for governance65 covering 
the key applications of human genome editing 
as well as a set of recommendations.66 This is 
helpful guidance for countries, many of which do 
not yet have a legal framework covering all human 
genome editing applications. 
B. Empower people through biotech education
Biosafety rules exist and are strictly adhered to 
in most countries when it comes to recognized 
institutions undertaking work on gene editing. 
They include, for example, storage requirements, 
design of laboratories, protocols to safeguard the 
health of researchers and measures to prevent 
the escape of organisms into the environment.67 
However, individuals and communities that are 
outside of recognized institutions, and who are 
experimenting with biotech also need to be made 
aware of and adhere to these biosafety rules.
In the years ahead, understanding the risks in the 
field of biotech is going to become increasingly 
important at an individual level. Misinformation 
and disinformation around biotech is a serious 
problem, with biohackers who are not medical 
professionals touting health remedies or 
performance-enhancing procedures based on 
biotech. As these uses of biotech become more 
ubiquitous, individuals will need to gain a more 
nuanced understanding of when it can be helpful 
to them, and when it may pose a danger to their 
health. A collaborative educational effort between 
the public sector, companies in the Biotech sector, 
and educational institutions should be launched to 
deepen citizens’ understanding of the technology 
and its risks.  
C. Incentivize biotech leaders to work in the
public sector
The public sector needs to continue to focus 
on making it attractive for the leading minds 
in the Biotech sector to work there, amid stiff 
competition from large pharma or technology 
companies, biotech startups or academia. The 
only way that regulators will be able to keep 
up with developments in biotech over the next 
decade will be to attract these top minds – if not 
into full-time employment then at least in the form 
of regular and intensive dialogue.

Super-ageing societies
2.5
	–
Pension crises will start to bite over the next decade in super-ageing societies as dependency ratios rise 
further and government finances are stretched.
	–
Labour shortages in several sectors, in particular long-term care, are likely to become a characteristic of 
super-ageing societies unless policies shift.  
	–
Super-ageing societies will pose global economic and labour-market challenges, even for countries still 
benefiting from their demographic dividend.
Countries are termed “super-ageing” or “super-
aged” when over 20% of their populations are 
over 65 years old.68 Several countries have already 
exceeded that mark, led by Japan69 and including 
some countries in Europe.70 Many more countries 
across Europe and Eastern Asia in particular are 
projected do so by 2035. Globally, the number of 
people aged 65 and older is expected to increase 
by 36%, from 857 million in 2025 to 1.2 billion in 
2035.71
By 2035, populations in super-ageing societies 
could be experiencing a set of interconnected 
and cascading risks that underscore the GRPS 
finding that the severity – albeit not the ranking – of 
the risk of Insufficient public infrastructure and 
social protections is expected to rise from the 
two-year to the 10-year time horizon (Figure 2.13). 
An ongoing concern is that government funding 
for public infrastructure and social protections gets 
diverted during short-term crises.  
Some super-ageing societies could be facing 
crises in their state pensions systems as well as 
in employer and private pensions, leading to more 
financial insecurity in old age and exacerbated 
pressure on the labour force, which includes a 
growing number of unpaid caregivers. Indeed, 
super-ageing societies by 2035 are likely to face 
labour shortages.
Ranked second globally according to the EOS, 
Labour and talent shortage is selected as the 
top risk in Europe and Eastern Asia, where super-
ageing is most pronounced. Twenty-one countries 
place the risk in first place, including two of the 
most super-ageing societies, Japan and Germany, 
while 40 other economies view it as one of the top 
five risks (Figure 2.14).
The long-term care sector will be especially 
affected by labour shortage. Care occupations are 
expected to see significant demand growth globally 
by 2030. Care systems – health care and social 
care – in super-ageing societies are already under 
clear and immediate strain. They will struggle to 
serve a fast-growing population over 60 years of 
age that has additional care needs while recruiting 
and retaining enough care workers. Care systems 
are, in great part, funded by governments and 
account for about 381 million jobs globally – 11.5% 
of total employment.72 The accumulation of debt

and competing spending needs on, for example, 
security and defense are likely to constrain the 
reach and sustainability of public expenditure 
on care systems over the next decade. Without 
increased public or blended investment, care 
demand will continue to be unmet.
Economies already experiencing this challenge 
are resorting to stop-gap measures, including 
attracting migrant care workers from other 
economies. But if this turns into a talent drain 
from countries with more youthful societies, those 
countries may then struggle to reap the benefits 
of their demographic dividend and will, several 
decades from now, run into super-ageing society 
challenges of their own. 
There will be no easy solutions to this problem 
set, given the sustained strength to 2035 of the 
two underlying trends generating higher average 
dependency ratios, not only across super-ageing 
societies, but at the global level: declining fertility 
rates and rising life expectancy, though not 
necessarily in better health.73
Pension crises
Over the next decade the pensions crises and 
their implications will start hitting home in super-
ageing societies, as it becomes clear that current 
state pension systems were designed for a 
much younger demographic with fewer years of 
retirement that needed funding. But it is not only 
state pension systems that will be struggling. 
Many employees are moving from Defined Benefits 
to Defined Contribution schemes – putting the 
onus on the individual to come up with strategies 
for saving over a lifetime. However, for many 
people this can be challenging as they may have 
insufficient income, lack the requisite financial 
understanding,74 or fail to make good early 
decisions about savings and retirement.75 
As dependency ratios rise, fewer people will be 
contributing to employer and private pensions 
schemes relative to the number of people whose 
retirements need funding, and with the length of 
those retirements rising. This will put pressure on 
institutional pension funds, some of which may 
seek to increase their returns by allocating higher 
proportions of their assets to riskier investments, 
such as crypto assets, private credit or other

alternative investments. These riskier investments 
will not always pay off, and over time this could 
worsen the already suboptimal funding ratios of 
some of these institutions. If there are extended 
periods of market underperformance, this could 
lead to many more individuals facing shortfalls in 
funding their retirement.76
The pension gaps in super-ageing societies will be 
exacerbated by the long-term impacts of the rise 
of the “gig economy” and the associated failure 
to make sufficient pensions contributions during 
periods of gig work. Pension shortfalls will also 
disproportionately affect lower-income workers 
who have not managed to make significant savings 
during their careers, even if they have been fully 
employed. In the EU, for example, already today one 
in five elderly people face the risk of poverty or social 
exclusion77 and this figure is set to rise by 2035. 
Women on average have significantly higher 
pensions gaps than men given time taken out of 
formal employment over the course of their careers 
to care for children or elderly relatives, as well as 
their lower average pay compared to men. In the 
EU, women’s pensions are nearly 30% lower than 
those of men, meaning that they are at a 35% higher 
risk of poverty.78 
The societal implications of Insufficient public 
infrastructure and social protections, such as 
pensions and care systems, are shown in Figure 
2.15, which reveals that Inequality was selected by 
GRPS respondents as a significant connected risk.
A common proposal for alleviating the pensions 
crisis in super-ageing societies is raising the 
statutory retirement age, and in some countries this 
has already occurred. However, attempts to do this 
to the extent needed to stem the pension crises 
will face resistance from voters, a rising proportion 
of whom are themselves close to retirement. This 
segment of the population tends to have high voter 
turnout, making it increasingly likely that policy 
outcomes will be in their favour. Intergenerational 
tensions could become an ongoing feature of super-
ageing societies, with discontented younger working 
cohorts resenting being called upon to pay more 
towards funding retiree pensions. 
There is also a gap between what global executives 
believe needs to be done to adjust pension schemes 
and what they view as businesses’ responsibilities. 
One-quarter of global executives (25%) support 
policy changes to pension schemes and retirement 
ages, but a lower share (14%) of executives view 
such measures as an effective business practice for 
expanding their talent base, as reported in the World 
Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025. This 
illustrates the complexity of aligning key stakeholder 
interests behind pension reforms.
Even if official retirement ages can be increased, the 
impact on reducing the scale of the pension crises 
may be smaller than hoped for. Some people do 
not manage to work to their expected retirement 
age, as their working lives are cut short by illness or 
disability, job loss or other reasons. The inability to 
extend retirement age is an especially significant risk 
for people in physically demanding jobs. However, 
many would like to be upskilled or reskilled to be 
able to extend their careers.

Long-term care crunch
In super-ageing societies, the balance between 
public sector, private sector and family support 
in the provision of long-term care is varied. The 
predominant case globally is that government 
healthcare and social services, and other 
government financial assistance for retirees, play 
important roles.79 In high-income countries with less 
of a contribution by the public sector, more of a role 
is played by private insurance, private care facilities, 
and home care services.80
Given the rising demand for its services, the care 
sector overall is set to need many more workers 
by 2035. In the United States, for example, 
demand for long-term care services and support 
workers alone is projected to grow by 44% from 
2020-2035.81 This rising demand needs to be set 
against an environment in which staff are often 
underpaid and overworked. Unless long-term 
care providers can find ways to improve pay and 
working conditions, the risk of labour shortages 
in the sector will only rise. Market forces can lead 
to more private-sector provision of long-term care 
filling some of the void. However, for many families, 
paying for private long-term care will remain out of 
reach financially. 
Immigration into super-ageing societies is 
already playing a role in addressing the sector’s 
labour needs. However, migrant workers are 
overrepresented in the less regulated areas of the 
care economy, such as home-based care and 
domestic work, and earn nearly 13% less than the 
national average.82 The political climate around 
immigration is strained and may become more 
so over the coming years, with anti-immigration 
policies becoming more mainstream in several 
super-ageing societies. 
Similarly, over a 10-year timeframe, there is only 
so much that increased labour-force participation 
in super-ageing societies can contribute to 
addressing the long-term care crunch. Attracting 
more women to enter the formal workforce can 
play a role. However, the balance of incentives 
available to women needs rethinking for there to 
be a meaningful change in female labour-force 
participation. Women currently provide two-thirds of 
unpaid work worldwide, which keeps 708 million of 
them from joining the labour force.83
Without meaningful transformation of the care 
sector and its resourcing, the scope for either 
immigration or increased labour force participation 
to solve the long-term care crunch over the next 10 
years remains limited. Governments and companies 
may be tempted to turn to technology in an effort 
to increase sectoral productivity. This can involve 
everything from automated reminders to take pills, 
to chatbots responding to medical queries and 
robots delivering meals, ideally freeing up time 
for more social interactions wherever possible. 
But while these and other technologies may help 
optimize care delivery and reach, demand for care 
skills and jobs is likely to be far from fully met by 
technological innovation
Super-ageing societies of the 
future
While today’s super-ageing societies are the ones 
that will feel the brunt of the negative impacts 
of demographic trends on their economies and 
societies over the next decade, ripple effects will 
be felt worldwide, leading to risks elsewhere, too. 
Global economic growth over the next decade is 
likely to be constrained by demographics in super-
ageing societies, many of which are among the 
world’s largest economies. In addition, there are 
likely to be direct knock-on impacts from today’s 
super-ageing societies. Despite policy pushback 
on immigration in the short-medium term, in the 
longer term the need to fill labour shortages could 
be decisive in shaping policy. As a consequence, 
countries with more youthful populations will face 
the risk of depletion of their own future workforces 
as many more young, working-age people migrate 
to super-ageing societies to help fill labour shortages 
there. Working-age people who remain in the super-
ageing societies of the future could be left hard-
pressed to sustain the rest of the populations there.

Many countries with youthful demographics are in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, which has by far the highest 
fertility rate globally.84 These demographics will help 
sustain rising working-age populations for several 
decades. But a key challenge over the next decade 
will be to generate employment opportunities on 
a sufficient scale and that offer job security. The 
International Labour Organization (ILO) notes that 
72% of young adult workers (aged 25 to 29) in the 
region are in a form of work deemed “insecure”.85 
Limited investment in human capital, which is 
essential to developing an attractive economy that 
can generate sufficient employment opportunities, 
is a significant risk.86 
Societies that are young today and looking at 
positive demographic trends for the next decade 
or more could ultimately follow similar demographic 
trajectories to the super-ageing societies of today 
and will then face problems that could be even 
more complex. While this risk may play out fully 
only over several decades, eventually low-income, 
super-ageing societies of the future could face 
a perfect storm – all the social and economic 
problems associated with today’s super-ageing 
societies but without fully developed social safety 
nets in place, and without the pools of private 
savings accumulated by some in today’s super-
ageing societies.
Actions for today
A. Further encourage flexible work policies
Organizations in both the public and private sectors 
need to further develop their flexible work policies 
as part of their Corporate strategies (Figure 2.16), 
with more options for leaving and coming back 
to the workforce at different life stages. This will 
help employees who are taking a non-linear life 
path, for example, including education, working 
across different sectors, and professional training 
or reskilling in the middle of a career, as well as 
years taken out to care for children or elderly family 
members before coming back to work.87
B. Campaign to improve pre-retirement health 
choices 
A large-scale, multi-faceted public-private effort 
to improve the health choices of future retirees 
should be launched. An impactful way to address 
the long-term care crisis, and to give the elderly 
the opportunity to contribute productively to the 
economy, is for individuals to lead healthier lives 
pre-retirement, thereby diminishing the need for 
long-term care in the first place. In Singapore, for 
example, the government is creating a “health 
district” to help their citizens live healthier, longer 
lives.88 Such initiatives can include helping people 
to understand the impacts of building healthy 
habits early on, focusing on key areas such as 
exercise, nutrition and social interactions. National 
and local regulations, the approach cited in the 
GRPS as having the most potential for driving 
action on risk reduction and preparedness when it 
comes to Insufficient public infrastructure and 
social protections, can play a role in this regard 
(Figure 2.16). The initiative would have not only 
an individual dimension, but a patriotic, national-
level one, too: By becoming healthier for longer, 
individuals can contribute to a stronger economy 
and lower fiscal pressures in the decades ahead.

C. Proactively build social cohesion across 
generations
At a societal level, all stakeholders need to 
reconsider the prospect of an inter-generational 
conflict playing out and take measures today to 
avoid that. The upcoming demographic shifts could 
be an opportunity to reframe the conversation. 
Every young person will become old, if they 
are lucky; engaging in more cross-generational 
social activities could increase life satisfaction for 
everyone, improve long-term social cohesion and 
provide real benefits towards resolving a range 
of global problems.89 More can also be done 
to encourage older individuals to remain in the 
workforce, for example by reskilling and by tailoring 
jobs more to their skill sets. Corporate strategies 
(Figure 2.16) also have a role to play: Organizations 
could consider incentivizing the creation of cross-
generational teams.

of the Global Risks Report over the last 20 years 
and the fluctuations of those rankings over that time 
period. The figure illustrates how consistently or 
variably each risk has been perceived over time, as 
represented by the standard deviation of its ranking. 
The sections that follow assess further how the 10-
year outlooks for key risks and risk categories have 
changed over the last two decades. 
Key trends in risk perceptions

The first edition of the Global Risks Report was 
launched in 2006 in a risks landscape characterized 
by terrorism and concerns around avian influenza, 
among other risks. Over the course of the 20 editions 
of the report, we have lived through significant events 
that have reshaped our economic and societal 
landscapes, from the 2007-2008 global financial 
crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also 
witnessed the compounding effects of the Structural 
forces of Technological acceleration, 
Geostrategic shifts, Climate change and 
Demographic bifurcation (Box 2.1). These 
Structural forces are determining long-term shifts 
in the arrangement of, and relation between, the 
systemic elements of the global landscape.

Average risk severity and ﬂuctuation over a 20-year period, based on the list of global risks in the 
Global Risks Report 2025. The x-axis represents the standard deviation of risk severity rankings, 
indicating volatility in risk perception. The y-axis denotes the average severity ranking, where 
higher values reﬂect more critical risks. Dot size corresponds to the frequency of a risk’s 
appearance across the last twenty editions of the Global Risks Report. Online harms was not 
included in Figure 2.17 due to being a new risk introduced in the Global Risks Report in 2025.

one that has been most consistently perceived 
as experiencing a clear ongoing systemic shift. 
Environmental risks have dramatically increased 
in ranking over the 10-year time horizon since the 
introduction of the Global Risks Report in 2006, 
and in recent years continuously rank as severe 
concerns. The highest-ranking environmental risks 
over the last 20 years have been Critical change to 
Earth systems, Extreme weather events, Natural 
resource shortages and Pollution, as highlighted 
in the upper-left quadrant of Figure 2.17. As the 
effects of Climate change-induced events and 
developments have become more visible over time, 
and public awareness of their implications has risen, 
the rankings of environmental risks have continued 
to rise.
The clearest example is Extreme-weather events, 
currently ranked as the #1 risk for the next 10 years. 
Since 2014, it has consistently ranked as a top 6 
risk (Figure 2.18). From 2017-2020 it ranked as the 
top risk and has retaken that spot since 2024.
The ranking of Extreme weather events has 
tended to rise as such events have worsened in 
intensity and frequency. Extreme weather events 
are becoming more common and expensive, with 
the cost per event having increased nearly 77%, 
inflation-adjusted, over the last five decades.90 The 
effects of climate change-driven Extreme weather 
events are being felt across the world and often hit 
the poorest communities the hardest. Global heat 
records continue to be broken.91 
The Pollution risk demonstrates shifting 
prominence over time in the 10-year risk outlook. 
First introduced in 2009, Pollution risk initially 
encompassed Air pollution and nanoparticles 
pollution (paint, cosmetics, healthcare). Over the 
subsequent 10 years, the risk evolved in concept 
and rose in perceived importance (Figure 2.19). In 
2017, Human-made environmental damage and 
disasters (e.g. oil spills, radioactive contamination, 
etc.) ranked #7 and entered the top 10 risks over 
the 10-year horizon. Ever since, concerns about 
Pollution, according to our historical GRPS data, 
have remained a top 10 long-term risk, and this 
year also ranked #6 over the two-year time horizon.
Among the other environmental risks, Critical 
change to Earth systems jumped in ranking in 
the 10-year risk outlook from #21 in 2013 to #4 in 
2014 and has been in the top five ever since, aside 
from 2017 when it was #6. Biodiversity loss and 
ecosystem collapse has experienced one of the 
largest increases in ranking among all risks, moving 
from #37 in 2009 to #2 in 2025.
Perennial worries about conflict 
Both State-based armed conflict and Intrastate 
violence feature in the upper-left quadrant of 
Figure 2.17, showing that concerns about conflict, 
although especially high today, have never been far 
from top of mind among decision-makers over the 
last 20 years.

Looking deeper into State-based armed conflict, 
its 10-year risk ranking experienced noticeable 
upticks in 2010-2011, when it rose from #24 to #7 
– perhaps in part because of the start of the Syrian
civil war in March 2011. A similar uptick is seen
from 2014-2015, as the war in Syria escalated, with
heavy casualties.92
The heightened long-term risk perceptions have 
unfortunately been validated by the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, and the wars in the Middle 
East and Sudan, among others. Indeed, State-
based armed conflict is the #1 short-term concern 
today among GRPS respondents. Section 1.3: 
“Geopolitical recession” notes the growing 
realization that we are in an era of conflict, without 
multilateral solutions in sight. 
State-based armed conflict is a clear example 
of the interconnected nature of risks and of 
their compounding effects. Conflict intensifies 
humanitarian crises, including Involuntary 
migration or displacement. Perceptions of this 
risk in the GRPS have experienced a pattern similar 
to that of State-based armed conflict, in particular 
from 2015 onwards.
Societal risks are the third major long-term 
concern
The third category of risks with a strong presence 
in the upper-left quadrant of Figure 2.17 is societal 
risks. Although this risk category has not featured 
in every edition of the Global Risks Report, five of 
the eight risks rank above the average: Inequality 
(wealth, income), Lack of economic opportunity 
or unemployment, Societal polarization, 
Infectious diseases, and Erosion of human rights 
and/or civic freedoms. 
Inequality, Lack of economic opportunity or 
unemployment, and Societal polarization are 
the three societal risks that have ranked high 
consistently. These rankings provided steady 
indications that we were moving towards a more 
polarized world. Looking at Societal polarization 
more closely, it has increased its ranking from #21 
when it was introduced in 2012 to #8 this year. 
Economic risks are perceived as less of a long-
term risk
Looking at Figure 2.17, six economic risks 
rank below the average over the last 20 years: 
Disruptions to critical infrastructure, Disruptions 
to a systematically important supply chain, 
Crime and illicit economic activity, Economic 
downturn, Inflation and Concentration of 
strategic resources (and technologies).
Only two economic risks have presented an 
above-average long-term threat according to GRPS 
respondents: Debt (corporate, public, household), 
which, as shown in Figure 2.20, has remained 
relatively stable as a long-term risk since the 2007-
2008 financial crisis, and Asset bubble burst.

While Asset bubble burst was one of the top-
ranked long-term risks during and in the immediate 
aftermath of the financial crisis, its ranking 
subsequently fell off sharply as the global economy 
regained a stable footing in subsequent years.
Technological acceleration is the structural 
force to watch
Perceptions of long-term technological risks 
have been among the most volatile of all the risks 
considered in the last 20 years of the Global Risks 
Report. While this can be explained by the current 
set of technology risks being relatively new to 
the report, it nonetheless is a warning sign that 
technological risks might be the area to watch the 
most for unexpected future risk developments. The 
impacts of technological acceleration are difficult 
to assess. Even going back to the first edition of 
the Global Risks Report in 2006, it was noted that 
risks associated with new technologies were among 
those whose outcomes were very unclear. 
Over the course of the 20 editions of the Global 
Risks Report, the category of technology has 
itself changed frequently, with risks in 2006 
related to the Convergence of technologies, 
Nanotechnology, Electromagnetic fields 
and Pervasive computing. Such threats have 
evolved markedly and today the category includes 
Misinformation and disinformation, Censorship 
and surveillance, Adverse outcomes of 
frontier technologies, Adverse outcomes of AI 
technologies, and Cyber espionage and warfare. 
Undoubtedly, this categorization will be subject to 
further significant realignment in the coming years 
given the pace and range of different possible 
directions of technological change.

Appendix A
Definitions and Global Risks List
Definitions
For the purposes of this report, “Climate 
change” is a structural force that encompasses 
the trajectories of global warming and possible 
consequences to Earth systems, reflecting 
anthropogenic actions and environmental changes.
“Demographic bifurcation” is a structural force 
that refers to changes to the size, growth and 
structure of national, regional or global populations, 
and the resulting impact on socioeconomic and 
political structures. It includes, but is not limited to, 
migration, fertility and ageing rates.
“Geostrategic shifts” is a structural force that 
refers to changing geopolitical power dynamics. 
It encompasses global and regional alliances and 
relations, the offensive and defensive projection of 
different sources of power (including economic), 
and national attitudes relating to key actors, 
governance mechanisms and strategic goals.
“Global risk” is the possibility of the occurrence 
of an event or condition that, if it occurs, would 
negatively impact a significant proportion of global 
GDP, population or natural resources.
“Structural force” is the long-term shift in the 
arrangement of and relation between the systemic 
elements of the global landscape. These shifts 
are not risks in and of themselves, but have the 
potential to materially influence the speed, spread 
and scope of global risks. These include but are not 
limited to: climate change, demographic bifurcation, 
geostrategic shifts and technological acceleration.
“Technological acceleration” is a structural force 
that refers to technological developments enabled 
by exponential growth in computing power and 
analysis. It has the potential to blur boundaries 
between technology and humanity, and rapidly give 
rise to novel and unpredictable global risks.
“Under-the-radar risk” is a global risk where new 
intelligence, a marked deterioration, key decision 
point or similar suggests that the severity of the risk 
(likelihood or impact) is increasing and/or is higher 
than indicated by global risk perceptions.
Global risk list
Table A.1 presents the list of 33 global risks and 
definitions adopted in the Global Risks Perception 
Survey 2024-2025 (GRPS).
To ensure legibility, the names of some of the global

Appendix B
Global Risks Perception Survey 2024-2025
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) 
is the World Economic Forum’s source of original 
risks data, harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s 
extensive network of academia, business, 
government, international organizations and civil 
society. Survey responses were collected from 2 
September to 18 October 2024 from the World 
Economic Forum’s multistakeholder communities. 
Updates to the GRPS 2024-2025
The list of 33 global risks included in the survey was 
updated in 2024 as follows: 	
–
One new risk was added in response to
observed trends in technological advancements
– “Online harms”, defined as the erosion of
protection from and/or prevalence of harmful
behaviour that poses a digital threat to the
emotional or mental health and well-being of
individuals. Includes, but is not limited to: online
child sexual abuse, online harassment and
cyber bullying.	
–
In addition:	
–
“Chronic health conditions” was renamed
“Decline in health and well-being” to update
clarity of risk for respondents.	
–
“Inequality or lack of economic opportunity”
has been separated out into two separate
societal risks: “Inequality (wealth, income)”
and “Lack of economic opportunity or
unemployment”, with “Unemployment”
merged with the latter.	
–
“Insufficient public infrastructure and
services” has been renamed “Insufficient
public infrastructure and social protections”.	
–
“Cyber insecurity” has been renamed “Cyber
espionage and warfare”, with cybercrime
now included as an economic risk within
“Crime and illicit economic activity (incl.
cyber)”, formerly referred to as “Illicit
economic activity”.	
–
“Technological power concentration” as a
technological risk has been recategorized as
an economic risk within “Concentration of
strategic resources and technologies”.	
–
“Intrastate armed conflict" has been
renamed “State-based armed conflict
(proxy, civil wars, coups, terrorism, etc.)”,
with “Terrorism” no longer a separate risk
but now merged within the definition.
Methodology
The GRPS 2024–2025 was further refined this year 
to gather more granular perceptions of risk and to 
incorporate new approaches to risk management 
and analysis. To that end, the GRPS 2024–2025 
was comprised of seven sections:	
–
Current risk landscape asked respondents to
select one risk among 33 pre-selected risks that
they believe is most likely to present a material
crisis on a global scale in 2025. The final rank is
based on a simple tally of the number of times
a risk was identified. This has changed from last
year, when respondents were asked to select
up to five risks among 20 pre-selected risks that
differed from the main risk list. The 33 options
are listed in Appendix A above. Respondents
were also able to write in additional risks to
Other, a free-text field.	
–
Short- and long-term risks landscape asked
respondents to estimate the likely impact
(severity) of each of the 33 global risks, on a 1-7
scale [1 = Low severity, 7 = High severity], over
both two-year and 10-year periods. “Severity”
is meant to take into consideration the impact
on populations, the economy or environmental
resources on a global scale. Respondents
were also allowed to nominate any other risk
considered missing from the 33 global risks. A
simple average based on the scores selected
was calculated. In addition, if a respondent
selected the highest severity score (7) for any
of the 33 risks, they were asked a follow-up
question to identify areas of particular concern
with respect to the identified risk.	
–
Consequences seeks to understand the
potential consequences of risks, to create a
network map of the global risk landscape.
Respondents were provided 10 randomly
selected global risks (from the full list of 33
global risks) and were then asked to select
up to five global risks (from the full list) likely
to be triggered by each of the 10 randomly
selected risks. In the visual results, “Nodes:
Risk influence” is based on a simple tally of
Global Risks Report 2025
78
all bidirectional relationships identified by 
respondents. “Edges: Relative influence” is 
based on a simple tally of the number of times 
the risk was identified as a consequence. 
The graphics in the report do not show all 
connections: weaker relationships identified by 
less than 25% of respondents were not included 
as edges.	
–
Risk governance asked respondents to identify
approach(es) that they expect to have the most
potential for driving action on risk reduction
and preparedness over the next 10 years,
with respect to the most severe risks (severity
score of 6 or 7 over the 10-year timeframe).
Respondents could choose among the following
nine approaches: Financial instruments
(e.g. insurance, catastrophe bonds, public
risk pools); National and local regulations
(e.g. environmental, operational, financial
regulations and incentives); Minilateral treaties
and agreements (e.g. Basel, Wassenaar,
regional free trade agreements); Global
treaties and agreements (e.g. United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change
[UNFCC], Paris, Montreal, Nonproliferation
Treaty [NPT], World Trade Organization [WTO]);
Development assistance (e.g. international
aid for disaster risk response and reduction);
Corporate strategies (e.g. environmental,
social and governance [ESG] reporting,
resilient supply chains, social initiatives,
public-private partnerships [PPPs]); Research
and development (e.g. new technologies,
early-warning systems, global risk research);
Public awareness and education (e.g.
campaigns, school curricula, media products);
Multistakeholder engagement (e.g. platforms
for exchanging knowledge, best practices,
alignment). A simple tally of the number of times
an approach was identified was calculated for
each risk. To ensure legibility, the names of
some of the global risks have been abbreviated
in the figures.	
–
Risk outlook asked respondents to
characterize the evolution of the global risks
landscape based on a number of factors. It
first asked respondents to select a statement
that they believe best characterizes the global
political environment for cooperation on
global risks in 10 years. Respondents were
provided with four options: (1) Continuation
or reinvigoration of the US-led, rules-based
international order; (2) Multipolar or fragmented
order in which middle and great powers contest,
set and enforce regional rules and norms; (3)
Bipolar or bifurcated order shaped by strategic
competition between two superpowers; (4)
Realignment towards a new international order
led by an alternative superpower. A simple tally
for each of the four options was calculated.	
–
Finally, respondents were asked to select a
statement that best characterizes their outlook
for the world over the next two and 10
years. Respondents were provided with the 
same five options for both time periods: (1) 
Calm: negligible risk of global catastrophes; (2) 
Stable: isolated disruptions, low risk of global 
catastrophes; (3) Unsettled: some instability, 
moderate risk of global catastrophes; (4) 
Turbulent: upheavals and elevated risk of global 
catastrophes; (5) Stormy: global catastrophic 
risks looming. A simple tally for each of the five 
options was calculated.
This year the risk outlook question asking 
respondents to indicate which statement best 
characterizes current and future global efforts to 
manage the Earth’s resources was removed from 
the survey in an effort to streamline questions asked 
to respondents 
Completion thresholds
A total of 1,112 responses to the GRPS were 
received. From these, 909 were kept, based on the 
threshold of at least one non-demographic answer, 
a minimum answer time of two minutes, and the 
filtering of multiple submissions based on browser 
cookies as well as partial responses that have 
overlapping IP numbers and demographic answers 
with a fully recorded response (100%).	
–
Current risk landscape: 909 respondents
selected at least one risk.	
–
Short- and long-term risks landscape: 780
respondents evaluated the severity of at least
one risk in one timeframe.	
–
Consequences: 596 respondents paired at
least one risk with one consequence.	
–
Risk governance: 461 respondents selected at
least one approach for at least one risk.	
–
Risk outlook: 562 respondents answered at
least one question.	
–
Outlook for the world: 561 respondents
answered over at least one timeframe.	
–
Sample distribution: 909 respondents who
answered at least one non-demographic
question were used to calculate the sample
distribution by place of residence (region),
gender, age, area of expertise and organization
type.

Appendix C
Executive Opinion Survey: National 
Risk Perceptions
Table C.1 presents the list of 34 risks that were 
incorporated into the World Economic Forum’s 
2024 Executive Opinion Survey (EOS), which 
was administered between April and August 2024. 
The risks are comparable to those in the GRPS 
2024-2025 but are applied at a more granular level 
to reflect the possible short-term and country-level 
manifestations of global risks. 
To ensure legibility, the names of some of the global 
risks have been abbreviated throughout this report. 
The portion of the full name used in the abbreviation 
is in bold.

Global Risks Report 2025
81
Over 11,000 respondents were presented with the 
following question: “Which five risks are the most 
likely to pose the biggest threat to your country 
in the next two years?” and were asked to select 
these from the list of 34 risks in Table C.1. 
“Risk 1” indicates the most frequently selected 
risk in each economy. Tied risks are presented 
in alphabetical order, with the tie indicated by 
numbering. 
To analyse the results of country or economy 
groups (such as the G20 or EU), country-level 
results are aggregated by taking a simple average 
of the ranking of the risk (from 1-34) by the 
countries or economies included in the group.
