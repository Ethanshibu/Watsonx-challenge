Climate Risk and Equity: Advancing Knowledge Toward a Sustainable Future - Introduction 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release

1 Introduction 
Climate change presents urgent, immediate, and long-term challenges to New York City (NYC). The New York City 
Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) was established in 2008 and codified in Local Law in 2012 to regularly assess the 
current state of the science on climate change and provide actionable policy-relevant recommendations for 
adaptation and resilience. This chapter introduces the 4th assessment report of the New York City Panel on Climate 
Change, NPCC4. 
NPCC4 builds on groundbreaking climate assessment work at the state level (e.g., New York State Climate Impacts 
Assessment (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 2024)) and in the region , especially the 
Metro East Coast Study (C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2001) and the City’s ongoing commitment to science-based 
policymaking informed by NPCC assessment reports associated with NPCC1 (C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2010), 
NPCC2 (C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2015), and NPCC3 (C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2019) as well as shorter special 
reports focused on climate risk information (C. Rosenzweig et al., 2009, 2013). NPCC4 includes new “climate 
projections of record” for NYC and grounds those climate futures in the social fabric of the city (Braneon et al., 2024). 
NPCC4 extends prior panels’ commitment to equity, engagement, and transparency of processes across the 
assessment report.  
The ﬁrst NPCC Report introduced risk management frameworks for the city and region via ﬂexible adaptation 
pathways. NPCC2 developed climate projections of record that were embedded in the City of New York resilience 
programs and regulations. NPCC3 introduced the concept of “co-generation” to the assessment process. NPCC4 
builds on and deepens these innovations. 
“The NPCC3 2019 Report co-generates new tools and methods for the next generation of Climate risk assessments 
and implementation of region-wide resilience. Co-generation is an interactive process by which stakeholders and 
scientists work together to produce climate change information that is targeted to decision-making needs. These 
tools and methods can be used to observe, project, and map climate extremes; monitor risks and responses; and 
engage with communities to develop effective programs. They are especially important at “transformation points” in 
the adaptation process when large changes in the structure and function of physical, ecological, and social systems 
of the city and region are undertaken” (C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2019) 
2 A Dynamic Context 
On December 19, 2019, the Mayor of New York appointed a group of five academics, researchers, and practitioners 
as co-chairs to lead the 4th New York City Panel on Climate Change. Providing expertise in climate science, 
engineering, social science, policy, design, and planning, the NPCC4 leadership team was convened with the 
ambition to support catalytic change during this next, and perhaps most crucial, decade of climate response in NYC. 
The co-chairs began meeting regularly with the Deputy Director for Climate Science and Risk Communication in the 
Mayor's Office of Resiliency1, now the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ). Together, they 
established a set of goals for the assessment, including identifying near, intermediate, and long-term quantitative and 
qualitative climate trends; assessing potential impacts of climate change on the city’s communities, vulnerable 
populations, public health, natural systems, critical infrastructure, and buildings; and expanding ways to use climate 
research to inform decision-making. From the outset, NPCC4 committed to strengthening participation by agencies 
and the public in the assessment process (see Section 4). The co-chairs and the Deputy Director then turned to 
identifying candidates to recommend to the Mayor to complete the full panel ensuring NPCC would meet its mandate 
to provide authoritative, actionable information on future climate change and its potential impacts in support of 
science-based decision-making by the City. However, between late December 2019 and June 2020, when the full 
panel was charged by the Mayor, the novel SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic emerged in full and, in a trauma that 
would lay bare the modern brutality of structural racism in the United States, George Floyd's murder in police custody 
was filmed in a live-streamed video that quickly spread worldwide. Other systemic shocks would follow, including an 
 
 
1 The key office for coordination with NPCC was the Mayor's Office of Resiliency (MOR), which then became the Mayor's Office of 
Climate Resiliency (MOCR) in April 2021, and then the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ) around 
January 2022. Adam Parris was the Deputy Director for Climate Science and Risk Communication in that office when NPCC4 was 
empaneled. Emilie Schnarr, Victoria Cerullo, and Hayley Elsasz subsequently held that or a similar post and acted as a key partner 
with the co-chairs in the 4th Assessment.

extreme rainfall and flooding event associated with the remnants of Hurricane Ida and the 13 deaths in NYC (and 
more than 45 deaths in the New York metropolitan region) that lay in its wake. As events continued to confirm that the 
context of the 4th assessment was shifting in real-time, the full panel went to work assuring NPCC4 would produce a 
report in support of the City’s initiatives to build resilience and equity into climate adaptation.  
The profound system-level shock of COVID-19 revealed additional challenges to the City’s resilience that will likely be 
exacerbated by current and future climate change. Climate change, like COVID-19, demands the full attention and 
commitment of the city government and the cooperation of local, state, federal, and global government, NGO, and 
private entities alike. Layering the impacts of significant, and likely, climate related system-level perturbations such as 
a hurricane or a sustained heat wave that threatens electrical grid capacity on top of a public health crisis, multiplies 
the complexity of the management challenge in the acute moment of impact, and complicates the long-term 
economic and ecological recovery. Advanced planning, dynamic and sustained adaptation, environmental and 
climate justice, as well as a commitment to ongoing assessment that reflects the state of emerging science are the 
hallmarks of a resilient city and the bedrock commitment of the NPCC. 
Incorporating lessons from the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic is consistent with the NPCC’s mandate. Projected 
increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events pose particular challenges to NYC in the short-term and 
over the course of the 21st century. Public health (and other) emergencies intersect with and amplify climate-related 
health impacts. Current data indicate that NYC neighborhoods that had the highest rates of positive COVID-19 cases 
also have higher proportions of service workers, rent-burdened households, and people of color (Do & Frank, 2021; 
Friedman & Lee, 2021; Marcotullio & Solecki, 2021; Mustafa et al., 2021; Ortiz et al., 2022).  
NPCC3 concluded that there is a need for further investigation into optimal methods to track social vulnerability to 
climate change and resilience at the community scale (Foster et al., 2019). In addition, the report concluded that 
illustrative indicators of energy sector transmission and distribution under extreme heat and humidity are needed. 
Furthermore, the report highlighted the critical importance of including attention to equity in all phases of climate 
adaptation efforts. In response, NPCC4 has incorporated equity considerations to a greater extent across all 
chapters.  
The altered context of climate hazards assessed in NPCC4 is not limited to the uneven geography of race and health. 
At the municipal, state, and national level, a rapidly changing policy environment including the recently released 
PlaNYC, LL97 of 2019, changes to NYC coastal zoning, the New York State Climate Impact Assessment, Justice40, 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to name only a few, demonstrate the 
unique opportunity amid the urgency of the climate crisis that NPCC4 seeks to highlight. In addition, the City of New 
York commissioned new Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA) research (McPhearson et al., 
2024) that has provided new information on biophysical climate and flooding science, the economic impacts on health 
from climate change, and the social-spatial geography of flood vulnerability. Much of the VIA work has been 
incorporated in NPCC4. 
What follows in this report is an assessment that offers policymakers, stakeholders, and communities a framework for 
centering equity, building flexible adaptation pathways, and incorporating sustained assessment processes that 
continue to evaluate and improve adaptation and mitigation of climate change. 
The workgroups in NPCC4 were responsive to this dynamic environment. The groups were formed based on 
meetings and input from city agencies about key and emerging climate risks for the city and on the expertise and 
capacities of the panel. Initially six workgroups were formed focusing on topics including flooding, health, equity, 
futures and transitions, climate science, and shared methods (see Figure 1). Climate science has been the backbone 
of all NPCC assessments including NPCC4. Health and Equity workgroups were introduced in NPCC2 and NPCC3, 
respectively. While tracing their origins to points of emphasis in prior NPCC assessments, the Flooding, Futures and 
Transitions, and Shared Methods workgroups represent new directions for the Panel in NPCC4. The workgroups 
were each led by two co-chairs and included panel members as well as external participants.  
Figure 1, showing a hand-drawn visual recording of a NPCC4 all-hands meeting in June 2021, reveals early 
aspirations for the content scoping of the workgroups. Over the course of the Assessment, these workgroups 
expanded to involve additional experts, met regularly, to define and write chapter(s), and to obtain input and feedback 
from a variety of stakeholders (see Section 4 below). Workgroups were designed to be cross-fertilized so that some 
panel members would participate in multiple groups. This approach fostered connections between workgroups and 
allowed for the fluid development of content. For example, the role of energy poverty on health and well-being was a 
clear focus of the health workgroup (see Figure 1); yet as aspects of the energy transitions were also developed in 
the Futures & Transition workgroup, it become evident that Energy and Energy Insecurity would be best addressed in 
a separate chapter. As Figure 2 makes clear, NPCC4 aimed to center equity throughout the work of the Assessment

from its earliest stages. Figure 2 (reflecting NPCC4’s kick-off meeting) also centers Co-Production of the Assessment 
with MOR (now MOCEJ). NPCC4 created hand-drawn visual recordings to document and reflect on the diversity of 
perspectives at various early meetings when the work of the full panel was getting underway. These drawings were 
produced in real-time during the meetings and redrawn upon reflection to capture and distill the key concepts, 
comments, people, and conclusions from each gathering. As participation in these meetings was entirely virtual, the 
note taking as shown in Figure 2 shows the active exchanges that occurred through chat (noted by the rectangular 
call-out boxes shown in the margins) as a feature of these meetings.  
In addition to this introduction and a concluding chapter, these efforts have resulted in six substantive chapters in this 
4th Assessment (See Section 5) along with the NYC Climate Risk Information 2022: Observations and Projections 
(Braneon et al., 2024), in addition to plain-language summaries that highlight the Assessment’s key findings.

3 Centering Equity  
The NPCC brings expertise in climate science, engineering, architecture, social science, public health, policy, design, 
and planning to the work of the 4th Assessment. Efforts to center equity in NPCC4 began with the panel’s formation. 
The full NPCC, with 20 members when seated in the spring of 2020, was more diverse than prior panels, in terms of 
gender, age, career stage, and racial and ethnic composition. Full membership, with the inclusion of additional 
external members (researchers, students, practitioners) to the workgroups, is even more diverse. Notably, this panel 
offers a much wider range of disciplinary expertise than prior panels – including climate scientists, geographers, 
demographers, economists, health experts, architects, ecologists, and planners among others – from which new 
framings for the work of the assessment, including centering the assessment on equity, can emerge.  
NPCC3 (2019) produced the first NPCC assessment report to devote a chapter of the report to questions surrounding 
equity in community vulnerability and adaptation (Foster et al., 2019). These efforts, which included development of a 
framework for incorporation of equity into the city’s climate adaptation planning efforts, were co-produced through 
collaboration between NPCC panel members, representatives from community-based environmental justice groups, 
and representatives from the City (Foster et al., 2019; Leichenko et al., 2023). Building upon NPCC3, NPCC4 
incorporates consideration of the equity implications of climate change adaptation in every chapter of the report.  
NPCC4 also made a deliberate decision to address justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in its collective work with 
special attention on incorporating racial equity in its own practices, procedures, and methods of assessment. To this 
end, each NPCC4 working group completed an interim report outlining the status of their work as it related to racial 
equity in the fall of 2022. Further, most panel members participated in a two-part racial equity training session (See

partnership with Luis Alejandro Tapia (https://www.louknows.com/). 
 
Figure 3. Johanna Tysk. Visual Notes from NPCC4 from Racial Equity Workshop and All-Hands Meeting, October 2021. 
The training sessions included panel members along with members of the City’s Environmental Justice Advisory 
Board (EJAB). The work included development of specific commitments to incorporate racial equity in workgroup 
operations and activities, and development of a rubric for assessment of each workgroup’s equity efforts. This rubric 
was used internally by each workgroup, first in 2022 to assess its practices and early chapter development efforts, 
and again in 2023 to assess its first order draft. The rubric entailed qualitative and quantitative assessment of the 
workgroup’s incorporation of equity3 into its internal processes and procedures, impact and policy analysis, and 
recommendations. The rubric draws from the work of Ibram X. Kendi (2019) as well as insights and suggestions from 
the BlackSpace team. The following topics were included in the rubric: 
■ 
Integration of equity and antiracism into internal processes and procedures. 
■ 
Acknowledgement of racial inequity as a problem of racist structures (including but not limited to historic and 
current policy, regulations, procedures, norms, and institutions); not just people with racist views.  
■ 
Reference to data and literature from racially and gender diverse sources, taking into consideration alternative 
forms of knowledge (i.e., Indigenous knowledge, storytelling, experiential knowledge). 
■ 
Identification of how climate impacts and policies intersect with racial inequity in any of its manifestations.

amplifying Black presence in the built environment. 
3 Antiracism is a powerful collection of antiracist policies that lead to racial equity and are substantiated by antiracist ideas. An 
antiracist idea is any idea that suggests the racial groups are equals in their apparent differences—that there is nothing right or 
wrong with any racial group. Antiracist ideas argue that racist policies are the cause of racial inequities (Kendi, 2019).

■ 
Investigation of policies, structures, and institutions causing racial inequity that intersect with climate impacts.  
■ 
Identification or creation of antiracist climate measures/strategies that aim to reduce and ideally eliminate 
racial inequity. 
■ 
Recommendation of strategies to monitor the impacts that antiracist climate measures/strategies have on 
reducing and eliminating racial inequity.  
■ 
Recommendation of strategies to support new antiracist climate actions and policies (and prevent actions and 
policies that reinforce racial inequity). 
■ 
Use of bias-free language and visuals that are culturally and racially sensitive (i.e., all appropriate groups are 
represented, visuals reflect lived experiences), providing definitions and clarification when necessary. 
The internal assessment was facilitated by an NPCC intern, Georgia Grzywacz, who also provided feedback to each 
workgroup based on her interaction with the group and her review of the first order chapter drafts. This process was 
designed to be inward-facing for each workgroup in order to provide opportunities to reflect on its equity-focus efforts 
and to adjust practices, processes, and assessment work as needed. 
4 Elements of the Assessment Process 
Transparency and accountability, along with scientific rigor, are cornerstones of any sustained assessment process. 
Thus, to guide the work of the panel, the co-chairs created a “Principles and Processes” document that was shared 
with all panel members (see BOX 1), edited by the full panel, and endorsed by all persons working on NPCC4. 
Sustained assessment refers to an ongoing process that engages researchers, professional practitioners, and 
stakeholders to share and apply knowledge and experience relevant to adaptation and mitigation solutions (Buizer et 
al., 2016; Moss et al., 2019). The concept was applied at the national scale in the third U.S. National Climate 
Assessment (NCA) (Hall et al., 2014; Melillo et al., 2014) as an approach to improve assessment outcomes and 
address expanding needs for decision-relevant information. Sustained dialogue with users is needed to identify 
information needs and decision contexts, establish useful communications formats, diversify products and 
communications, and build capacity to use available science and technical information in taking action. It has the 
potential to promote collaborative learning and establish leading practices (i.e., professional standards) for climate 
risk management strategies so that available knowledge is tailored for specific environmental, socioeconomic, and 
cultural contexts.

 BOX 1. NPCC4 Principles and Processes 
An important component of sustained assessment is co-production. Much of NPCC4’s success has been predicated 
on embracing a co-production approach (see Box 2)– that is, by engagement between members of the panel and 
many stakeholders in local agencies from city government to other public and private organizations (Foster et al., 
2019; C. Rosenzweig et al., 2011; C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2019). Co-produced climate assessments are 
increasingly recognized as a means of improving the effective generation and utilization of climate information to 
inform decision-making and support adaptation to climate change. However, as scholars and practitioners have 
illustrated, co-production does present potential pitfalls (e.g., transactional costs) for scientists, decision-makers, and 
community members (Cvitanovic et al., 2019; Lemos et al., 2018). NPCC has weathered these potential pitfalls and, 
as the appointment of NPCC4 suggests, co-production remains a cornerstone of the City’s climate response. 
NPCC outlined a framework for co-production and partnership between the City of New York, principally the Mayor’s 
Office of Resiliency (now MOCEJ), and NPCC specifically for the 4th assessment cycle of NPCC (i.e.,NPCC4). The 
actions outlined in BOX 2 were intended to allow for an agile and authoritative process (and are not listed in order of 
priority or emphasis). 
 
 
In general, the products and activities of the Panel will analyze and present the knowledge necessary for decision making and 
implementation of climate change policies and actions. The Panel’s products will inform New York City’s efforts to address the 
climate crisis. They will identify key gaps in climate knowledge and research needs relevant to these efforts. In addition, the 
Panel seeks to enhance accountability for translation of climate knowledge to action through effective engagement and 
communication on climate-related issues with a range of audiences. Some of the key principles and processes for the 4th cycle 
of the Panel’s work are described below. 
Deliberation and use of information:  
■ 
NPCC4 will operate in a transparent, accountable, and rigorous fashion. This includes transparency in its public 
meetings and decision-making processes.  
■ 
Adoption of the Panel’s work plan, approval of reports and summaries for public release, and other major decisions 
will be made by consensus of the Panel. Members are expected to work towards consensus in good faith, but if 
during the process of approving reports and other materials consensus cannot be reached, dissenting opinions may 
be noted.  
■ 
The Co-Chairs may make decisions on behalf of the Panel for routine procedural matters or when more rapid 
decisions are needed in between Panel meetings. The Co-Chairs commit to the rest of the Panel to consult with 
them on any major issues that could call into question Panel members’ roles or judgment. 
■ 
The NPCC will address justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in its work. This commitment extends to bringing to 
light how systemic racism and injustice intensify the impacts of climate change and how anti-racist policies can be 
integrated into climate action to promote a just, resilient, sustainable, and more vibrant future. 
Traceable accounts: 
■ 
NPCC will strive to make its products accessible and useful to decision-makers and the general public. It will engage 
with the intended audiences and users of Panel products, adopting a “co-production” or “sustained assessment” 
approach to its work. This approach will facilitate the relevance, credibility, and legitimacy of Panel products and 
activities.  
■ 
The Panel will reach its conclusions collectively. Individual panel members do not speak “for the NPCC” except when 
they represent agreed findings or decisions. 
■ 
NPCC4 will adopt a consistent framework and process for assessing and reporting on levels of confidence and 
significant sources of uncertainty. This will facilitate effective communication with users.  
■ 
The Panel will rely on published, peer-reviewed sources of information whenever possible. However, the Panel 
recognizes that invaluable information relevant to its work may come from non-peer reviewed sources. NPCC4 will 
use standards on information quality and transparency to provide open-source documentation of all data used in its 
products.

BOX 2. Co-Production: Actions and Accountability 
 
Co-production in the NPCC4 occurred at the level of the Panel’s workgroups in several ways. In some cases, the 
workgroups identified ongoing consultations and efforts that engaged communities, relevant professionals, and 
scientists to discuss future hazards, their impacts, and what can be done to prepare (e.g., OneNYC2050 and NYC 
Adaptation Scenarios 2100 (Cook et al., 2022). While gaps and challenges remain, these engagements offered an 
opportunity for building out more effective dialogue about future climate action in the city. In other cases, the 
workgroups reviewed information needs identified through the Climate Knowledge Exchange 2021 report (City of 
New York, 2022) and offered suggestions for the City to convene communities of practice to dive deeper and develop 
required information. And in some cases, the workgroups convened public meetings focused on issues of concern 
(e.g., stormwater management or displacement) identified in their chapters. While resources available to the NPCC 
were not sufficient to convene and sustain these processes, these discussions provide ideas for the future, 
Action 
Description 
Action 1 
Form an Executive Committee including leadership from MOR and NPCC. 
Action 2 
Facilitate coordination between NPCC, the Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (CCATF), and the 
Environmental Justice Advisory Board (EJAB), including potentially a joint working group or committee. 
Action 3 
Form a Fundraising Committee for NPCC with joint leadership from MOR and NPCC. 
Action 4 
Develop scenario planning and climate knowledge briefs as collaborative projects between MOR, NPCC, and 
partners. 
Action 5 
Create an MOR-NPCC Fellows Program. 
Progress was made on all five actions, to varying degrees.  
Actions 1, 4 and 5 were fully implemented for NPCC4, and future NPCC assessments may choose to maintain and build on 
those efforts. For example, the MOR-NPCC Fellows Program (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021) (Action 5) 
was responsive to the City’s current internship programs (i.e., that they must be paid or receiving academic credit) and, 
consistent with Action 3, may need future resourcing to meet NPCC’s inclusivity objectives.  
Because panel members of NPCC, like IPCC and NCA, work on a volunteer basis, the issue of resourcing the assessment 
(both administratively and substantively) -- that is, Action 3 -- was identified as an important area to be developed. NPCC4 
made important progress on Action 3 via resource allocation that was essential to its mandate. Funding for report 
administration, support, and production was allocated by NYC. Although these funds were identified late in the process (almost 
three years after the panel was seated) the final report critically relied on the support from the administrative contract after a 
competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) process.  
In addition, as noted above, NYC commissioned new Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA) research 
during the timeframe of NPCC4 through an open RFP process. Though not predicated on NPCC, the City’s commitment to 
original research significantly advanced NPCC4 and future panels.  
As for Action 2, NPCC4 met with CCATF virtually in November 2021. With about 150 persons representing government and 
quasi-government agencies, this was the only meeting organized by MOCR/MOCEJ between CCATF and NPCC4. There were 
no further engagements with CCATF because it has not been convened since 2021. Because the City valued multiple 
touchpoints with NPCC, it developed a broad Interagency Climate Assessment Team (ICAT) -- comprising about 16 individuals 
representing 8 agencies -- to foster engagement with city agencies and the NPCC workgroups.  
These actions established principles for NPCC4 to ensure an iterative and meaningful stakeholder engagement for shared 
learning and collaboration – that is, co-production and sustained assessment activities (Lemos & Morehouse, 2005; Meadow et 
al., 2015; Vincent et al., 2018) -- in order to align its work with just and resilient climate action.   
To ensure access and uptake to NPCC4 products, NPCC has produced a website [https://climateassessment.nyc] with access 
to data, plan-language summaries for each chapter, and a variety of other climate-change related resources.

particularly for sustained assessment and ongoing collaborations. The Climate Knowledge Exchange (2024) 
continues to provide a forum for sharing scientific climate information, receiving input from diverse stakeholders, and 
co-producing climate research priorities. Finally, all chapters engaged with relevant members of ICAT (See Box 2) in 
the drafting process of their chapters.  
5 Organization of NPCC4 Assessment Report 
The 4th Assessment is divided into the following six chapters, in addition to this Introduction, a Conclusion with 
recommendations for next steps, and the Climate Science Special Report (Braneon et al., 2024):

projections of record for NYC; new sea level rise projections of record are confirmed in Braneon et al.(Braneon et al., 
2024). Foster at al., (2024) build on the findings and recommendations to the City from the NPCC3 equity workgroup 
to identify additional metrics and adaptation efforts that can advance climate justice. Rosenzweig et al., (2024) 
provide a comprehensive description of the different types of flood hazards facing NYC and provide climatological 
context that can be utilized, along with climate change projections, to support flood risk management (FRM). Balk et 
al., (2024) synthesize the state of knowledge on social-demographic, economic, transportation, housing, health 
futures, and many other subsystems of the complex system of NYC that will all interact to determine the City’s 
futures. Matte et al., (2024) update evidence since the last NPCC health assessment in 2015 as part of NPCC2 
(Kinney et al., 2015) and address climate health risks as well as vulnerabilities with an emphasis on heat and 
flooding. Yoon et al.,(2024) provide an overview of energy trends in NYC and the State, considers challenges and 
barriers in energy transition, and implications for energy insecurity, which can have profound and inequitable impacts 
on human health and wellbeing. Through this collection of technical reports (e.g. Balk et al.(2024), Braneon et 
al.(2024), Foster et al.(2024), Matte et al.(2024), Ortiz et al.(2024), and Yoon et al.(2024)), NPCC4 continues its 
mandate of providing NYC with essential climate information while centering that knowledge in the dynamic socio-
ecological environment of today.

Abstract: 
We summarize historic New York City (NYC) climate change trends and provide the latest scientific analyses on 
projected future changes based on a range of global greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Building on previous 
NPCC assessment reports we describe new methods used to develop the projections of record for sea level rise, 
temperature, and precipitation for the City, including using projections across multiple emissions pathways and the 
issue of the “hot models” associated with CMIP6 and their potential impact on NYC’s climate projections. We 
describe the state of the science on temperature variability within NYC and explain both the large scale and regional 
dynamics that lead to extreme heat events, as well as the local physical drivers that lead to inequitable distributions of 
exposure to extreme heat. We identify three areas of tail risk and potential for its mischaracterization, including the 
physical processes of extreme events and effects of a changing climate. Finally, we review opportunities for future 
research, with a focus on the hot model problem and the intersection of spatial resolution of projections with gaps in 
knowledge in the impacts of the climate signal on intra-urban heat and heat exposure.

1 Chapter Summary  
This chapter summarizes historic New York City (NYC) climate change trends and provides the latest state-of-the-art 
science information on potential future changes based on a range of global greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. 
This chapter further describes the drivers and consequences of climate change in NYC related to sea level rise, 
extreme heat, and precipitation. Projections of annual averages, the frequency of extreme temperatures and 
precipitation are presented, refining methods used in previous New York City Panel of Climate Change (NPCC) 
reports.  
1.1 
Key Messages 
Key Message 1 - NPCC4 analysis of the impact of hot models on the CMIP6 ensemble found no statistically 
significant difference between the temperature and precipitation projections of record and alternative projections that 
do not include models with equilibrium climate sensitivity outside the expected range. The CMIP6 climate model 
ensemble used to create the temperature and precipitation projections of record contains three models that display 
higher-than-expected sensitivity of temperatures to greenhouse gases. These so-called “hot models” lead to higher 
global mean temperatures. However, the impact of high climate sensitivity appears small with our approach to 
developing local projections for NYC. Nevertheless, more research is needed to better understand (1) the impact of 
the high climate sensitivity on the representation of key large scale climate processes, (2) the model physics leading 
to high sensitivity in the first place, and (3) the constraints on the planet’s equilibrium climate sensitivity.  
Key Message 2: The high tail end of sea level rise will be governed by the future stability of the ice sheets, and in 
particular, that of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), with ~3 m of SLR potential if all its marine-based ice melted, 
and also that of the Greenland Ice Sheet (~7 m SLR equivalent) throughout the 21st century and beyond. Troubling 
signs of ice shelf thinning and ocean warming around WAIS and an approaching temperature tipping point over 
Greenland raise the possibility of faster and higher sea level rise than projected by most climate models, increasing 
the risks associated with coastal flooding. Additional research is needed to gain a better understanding of all the 
processes governing ice sheet behavior with rising temperatures. Stakeholders concerned with long-term planning 
need to examine plausible scenarios at the extreme upper tail of the sea level rise distribution. 
Key Message 3: While occurrence of extreme heat events in NYC is governed in great part by climatic events taking 
place at large spatial scales, local urbanization patterns play a key role in the spatial distribution of temperatures 
within the city. These local patterns, which include a range of factors like distribution of green spaces and urban 
geometry, play the most significant role in the generation of physical process that lead to the urban heat island (UHI). 
Moreover, extreme heat events exacerbate this intra-urban excess temperatures, increasing exposure to deadly heat 
of populations without access to adaptive measures and cooling infrastructure (e.g., cooling centers, tree shade). 
Future work is needed to assess the impact of a warming climate on intra-urban heat variability in order quantify the 
effect of climate change on spatial inequities of heat exposure.  
2 Introduction 
 
While every NPCC assessment report has included a chapter on the state of climate science and projections for 
NYC, this chapter includes a strengthened emphasis on the equity implications of climate change adaptation 
(Boeckmann & Zeeb, 2016; Foster et al., 2019). In addition, this chapter addresses emerging issues related to 
higher-than-expected equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in several ensemble members from the 6th Climate Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which simulate higher than expected global mean temperatures. Finally, the 
chapter describes the changing tail and compound risks associated with climate change. 
2.1 
Chapter Scope and Context  
Anthropogenic climate change is fundamentally linked to the rapid increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
propelled by the Industrial Revolution and the European colonial systems that enabled it. “Raw materials from 
colonies across the British Empire fueled the Industrial Revolution” (Easton et al., 2022), land dispossession and 
forced migration facilitated colonial expansion, and chattel slavery provided unpaid labor to build the British colonies

as well as the new American nation1 (Baker, 2019; Foster et al., 2024, sec. 3.1; Munshi, 2022; Park, 2022). In 
addition, the "political arithmetic" of global trade prompted extreme extraction from the New York metropolitan 
region's biodiversity into the Atlantic world trading system (Tchen, 2001). Consequently, humanity’s climate crisis has 
its roots in land dispossession, forced migration, as well as human and natural resource extraction orchestrated by 
European colonial powers. Furthermore, the tremendous variability in vulnerability to climate change (among and 
within regions) is driven by “patterns of intersecting socio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, 
inequity, and marginalization” as well as “historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism” and 
structural racism (e.g. Home Owners Loan Corporation redlining in NYC’s five boroughs) (Braveman et al., 2022; 
Egede et al., 2023; Farrell et al., 2021; Lynch et al., 2021; Pörtner et al., 2022; Sultana, 2022).

Vulnerability to climate hazards and stressors (Figure 1) (Field et al., 2014, p. 49) is unequally distributed across NYC 
as “high levels of social vulnerability are consistently found in areas with lower incomes”, aging populations, and 
higher proportions of Black and Latinx/Hispanic residents (Foster et al., 2019). For example, NYC is among urban 
hotspots in the country where ambient temperatures can be 5 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter in neighborhoods with 
low income households and more residents of color (Hoffman et al., 2020). NYC also has the largest number of 
affordable housing units exposed to extreme water levels in the country (Buchanan et al., 2020).  
Local Law 42 (2012) mandates that the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) meet at least twice a year 
for the purpose of (i) reviewing the most recent scientific data related to climate change and its potential impacts on 
the City’s communities, vulnerable populations and public health2 as well as the City’s natural systems, critical 
infrastructure, buildings and economy; and (ii) advising municipal staff (e.g. the Mayor’s Office of Climate and 
Environmental Justice) as well as the NYC Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (CCATF). Further, the Panel3 is 
mandated by LL42 to make recommendations regarding (i) the near-, intermediate and long-term quantitative and 
 
 
1 The U.S. share of global GHG emissions is currently around 15 percent (Sachs, 2020). 
2 Vulnerable populations are defined here as persons or communities at increased risk of harm as a direct or indirect consequence 
of climate change based on one or more of the following risk factors: (i) proximity to disproportionally impacted areas; (ii) age, 
including senior citizen or minor status; (iii) income level; (iv) disability; (v) chronic or mental illness; and (vi) language. Public health 
is defined here as impacts on physical health, mental health and social well-being and public or private services that treat and 
prevent disease, prolong life and promote health. 
3 The Panel is currently led by a team of four co-chairs who possess a broad spectrum of disciplinary expertise including climate 
science, demography, civil and environmental engineering, geography, vulnerability analysis, global change, architecture, and urban 
planning. Both the full NPCC and its leadership team were selected to ensure a diversity of backgrounds, research disciplines, and 
fields of technical practice.

qualitative climate projections (i.e. “projections of record”) for the City of New York; and (ii) a framework for 
stakeholders to incorporate climate projections into their planning processes (Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2015).  
In 2023, NPCC published a brief assessment report that aimed to mirror its 2013 report See Rosenzweig et al., 
(2013). It establishes new sea level rise projections of record for NYC and introduces interim climate projections 
associated with temperature and precipitation. Further, the climate science synthesis focused on sea level rise that is 
presented by NPCC4 in NYC Climate Risk Information 2022: Observations and Projections (Braneon et al., 2024) 
addresses recommendations from NPCC3 to (a) “monitor trends in sea level rise and in the processes contributing to 
sea level rise in the New York metropolitan region”, (b) “study trajectories of potential sea level rise that continue after 
2100 in light of the sea level rise commitment on longer timescales”, and (c) “examine the consequences of long-term 
sea level rise scenarios on coastal flooding, including those stemming from low-probability, high-end scenarios” 
(Gornitz et al., 2019).  
This chapter presents the finalized projections of record4 associated with temperature and precipitation. These 
projections use new methods that derive expected changes in NYC’s temperature and precipitation from global 
climate models, both in terms of average conditions as well as climate extremes. The projections use the newest 
generation of climate models from CMIP6, which include significant advances in the representation of the process 
that form the climate system and the impacts of anthropogenic emissions. New methods for downscaling these global 
projections are introduced which account for changes to not only the mean state of local climate but also in the 
variability of temperature and precipitation.  
The chapter also describes potential impacts of climate change on intra-urban heat variability. While the chapter does 
not update the projections of NPCC3 that mapped temperatures at the neighborhood scale for select future periods of 
time (González et al., 2019), it describes the local and global drivers of extreme heat in the city. Moreover, new 
projections of compound heat and humidity are presented. A new section also describes growing evidence of global 
climate change leading to stronger urban heat islands (UHIs) as well as physical interactions that may exacerbate the 
City’s UHI.  
2.2 
Chapter Organization 
This chapter contains three sections that describe changing climate risks in NYC. Section 3 builds on previous NPCC 
assessment reports by describing the latest climate science and data, while describing new methods used to develop 
the projections of record for sea level rise, temperature, and precipitation for the City. This section also describes the 
approach followed by NPCC4 for using projections across multiple emissions pathways. Finally, Section 3 also 
discusses the issue of the “hot models” associated with CMIP6 and their potential impact on NYC’s climate 
projections. Section 4 describes the state of the science on temperature variability within the city. This section 
explains both the large scale and regional dynamics that lead to extreme heat events, as well as the local physical 
drivers that lead to inequitable distributions of exposure to extreme heat. Section 5 describes the physical processes 
and the impact of a changing climate on tail risks and extreme events. Finally, Section 6 reviews opportunities for 
future research, with a focus on the hot model problem and the intersection of spatial resolution of projections with 
gaps in knowledge in the impacts of the climate signal on intra-urban heat and heat exposure. 
3 Sustained assessment and CMIP6 
This report follows prior NPCC assessments that developed climate projections for NYC. Presented here is a 
summary of the methods and how the key components of the projections have changed over time. Braneon et al., 
(2024) and the New York State Climate Impacts Assessment (NYSCIA) (New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority, 2024) provide a more detailed description of the analytic methodology. The NYSCIA contains 
a detailed breakdown of the differences in each "element" of the projections (e.g., baseline period, number of models 
used, emissions scenarios). 
 
 
4 Based on climate analyses, regional and global trends, and a review of scientific literature, NPCC confirms which climate 
projections of temperature, precipitation, sea level rise, and coastal flooding (i.e. projections of record) are most appropriate for use 
in resiliency planning for the city and region.

3.1 
Identifying the Differences/Updates in the Climate Projections 
Changes in the projections in this NPCC4 report include 1) the use of new emissions scenarios and global climate 
models, 2) updated historical baseline period and future time slices for projections, and 3) new methods for 
projections of quantitative extreme events and sea level rise. 
3.1.1 
Emissions scenarios and global climate models  
The newest climate science available is associated with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6); its 
shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) are part of a new scenario framework (Ebi et al., 2014; O’Neill et al., 2016), 
established by the climate change research community to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, 
vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The updated climate projections for NYC utilize data (both monthly and 
daily) from the CMIP6 ensemble of global climate models. For a specific description of the methods used, refer to 
Braneon et al. (2024).  
CMIP6 global climate models have, in general, a higher spatial resolution than CMIP5 (the previous iteration of 
models utilized by the IPCC); grid box sizes for many models are on the order of approximately 70 miles by 70 miles 
horizontally, whereas a common resolution for CMIP5 was approximately 140 miles by 140 miles. CMIP6 models also 
feature more advanced characterization of key system components, such as stratospheric chemistry, and more 
dynamic coupling across system components. The climate sensitivity—a measure of how sensitive global average 
temperatures are to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations—is higher in approximately one-fourth of CMIP6 
models than in CMIP5 and earlier CMIP generations (Zelinka et al., 2020) In addition to presenting projections for 
NYC based on CMIP6, this chapter also examines the potential impact of these so-called “hot models”.  
3.1.2 
Historical base period and future timeslices  
The historical baseline periods for the climate projections are updated for NPCC4. Projections of temperature are 
expressed relative to a baseline period of 1981 to 2010 for temperature and precipitation while the baseline period is 
1995 to 2014 for sea level rise. In addition, projections are now provided for each decade from the 2030s through the 
2080s (See Braneon et al (2024) for more details). The methods still use a 30-year average for the time periods (10-
year average for sea level rise) to reduce the noise of year-to-year variability while the climate change signal remains. 
3.1.3 
New methods for extreme events and sea level rise 
For the projections in NPCC4, new methodologies are used for quantitative extreme events and sea level rise.  Full 
details of these methods can be found in Braneon et al., (2024), however, this section identifies some of the key 
updates. 
In NPCC4, quantile mapping is used to combine the daily outputs from the global climate models (GCMs) with 
historical climate data to develop future climate projections that include daily extremes like hot days, defined as days 
with maximum temperature above 90°F and days with heavy rainfall, defined as days with at least 1 inch total 
precipitation. Quantile mapping represents an advance from prior NPCC work, which used the delta method based on 
monthly rather than daily data from GCMs. Whereas the delta method largely retains the distribution of temperatures 
from the historical observed data--only adding a mean, or 'delta' uniformly to the historical data, quantile mapping of 
daily data retains changes in the distribution of temperatures with climate change, as simulated by GCMs. For 
example, if a model has its top one percent of hottest days warming more than other days, quantile mapping will lead 
to projections with larger increases in hot day frequency and intensity than would be generated by the delta method 
(Panofsky & Brier, 1968). 
The downscaling technique used in this work is one of many used in climate research, and while all are generally 
considered to render 'value added' projections (by addressing GCM biases and adding finer spatial resolution), the 
methods do not produce identical results. The downscaling technique used here should not be considered inherently 
superior to other possible downscaling choices. 
The development of a comprehensive approach to sea level rise in the latest IPCC report (AR6) offered the 
opportunity to rely on methods and data generated by the IPCC rather than recreating data already available.  For 
NYC, outputs are taken directly from the IPCC data set for the Battery for three scenarios; SSP2-4.5-medium 
confidence, SSP5-8.5-medium confidence, and SSP5-8.5-low confidence (Kopp et al., 2023). Because this data is 
available for years at the start of each decade (e.g., 2050), we interpolated the values to the middle year (e.g., 2055) 
of the decade, to align with the decadal time periods (e.g., the 2050s) previously used for NPCC sea level rise 
projections. Sea level rise projections are computed for all decades from the 2030s to the 2090s and then 2100 and 
2150.

3.1.4 
Additional methodological changes and advances 
The observed rate of mean sea level rise of 4.3 ± 1.08 mm/yr (1992-2021) at the Battery in NYC (National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2023; National Oceanography Centre, 2023) remains higher that of the 
observed rate of global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) of 3.3 [2.8-2.2] mm/yr (1993-2018) (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021, 
tbl. 9.5). This higher relative, or local rate of sea level rise (RSLR) derives from a combination of glacial isostatic 
adjustment (GIA) related subsidence, enhanced thermal expansion, and increasing distant land ice mass losses (see 
also Braneon et al., 2024; Section 4.1.1).New hotspots of highly localized land uplift and subsidence in NYC that 
cause variations in RSLR have been recently identified by interferometric synthetic aperture radar and other satellite 
data (Buzzanga et al., 2023). Most of these hotspots are situated on land fill or on heavily modified ground. The very 
localized variations in RSLR may produce highly differential coastal flood risk across the city. In addition, there is 
some evidence that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)  weakening in the future, which would 
lead to higher RSLR along much of the East Coast and increase the likelihood of higher coastal flooding (Little et al., 
2019; Volkov et al., 2023). In addition, the AMOC plays a role in a “domino effect” of tipping points, which may add 
uncertainty its role in RSLR (Wunderling et al., 2021) and other changes throughout the climate system. 
Sea level rise and coastal flooding pose growing risks to the population and major economic assets along and 
beyond NYC's waterfront. Rising sea level is leading to an increased frequency of coastal flooding in New York City 
and elsewhere in the United States (e.g. Sweet et al., ( 2022). Future sea level rise will exacerbate high tide flooding 
as well as the destruction caused by storm surges (Strauss et al., 2021).

SSP1-2.6 Low Confidence and SSP5-8.5 Low Confidence scenarios that indicate the indicate the potential impact of deeply 
uncertain ice sheet processes. Source: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (2023)  
While the “ambiguity” associated with ice-sheet instability limited the ability of NPCC3 (and earlier Panels) to 
generate quantitative sea-level projections of record (Gornitz et al., 1982; Kopp et al., 2023; Mercer, 1978; 
Oppenheimer et al., 2019) that explicitly account for this, NPCC4 utilizes sea level rise projections from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Sea Level Projection Tool (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Garner et al., 
2021; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2023) to present a broad range of plausible outcomes that

8 
explicitly account for ice sheet processes5 (Bamber et al., 2019; DeConto et al., 2021) that are deeply uncertain 
(Bassis, 2021; Braneon et al., 2024). The tool allows users to view both global and regional sea level projections from 
2020 to 2150, along with how these projections differ depending on future scenario or warming level (See Figure 2 
from NASA (2023).  
While the sea level rise projections available from the NASA Sea Level Projection Tool for NYC are consistent with 
the assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) described in IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (See 
Box 9.3 and Sections 9.6.3 and 9.7 in Fox-Kemper et al., (2021), some members of the climate science community 
(e.g. Hausfather et al., (2022) have begun developing different approaches (e.g. “model culling” or rejecting some 
models’ projections) for projecting local temperature and precipitation changes that explicitly address the fact that 
some GCMs’ transient warming lies outside the bounds of the IPCC AR6 assessed “likely” range of ECS or transient 
climate response (TCR) (Table 1 in Rypdal et al., (2021) shows a TCR span of 1.3–3.0°C in the CMIP6 experiments). 
A consequential aspect of the model culling approach is that “rejecting models is akin to applying a binary weighting 
scheme to the CMIP6 ensemble, with zero weight applied to the culled models”, and model democracy” (e.g. equal 
weighting) for the remaining ensemble members (Massoud et al., 2023). As model culling (or unequal weighting) 
results in eliminating (or significantly reducing) consideration of the information provided by a significant portion of the 
model ensemble, NPCC4 has elected to conduct data-driven analyses to understand if the so-called “hot model” 
problem (Hausfather et al., 2022) has a statistically significant impact on the bias-corrected temperature and 
precipitation projections presented in Braneon et al. (2024; Massoud et al., 2023; Weigel et al., 2010). 
“In climate science, one of the most fundamental pursuits is determination of the significance of differences between 
two states or sets of conditions” (Lanzante, 2021). Multiple statistical tests were conducted with the ensemble of 
GCM means that is used to develop the temperature and precipitation projections that are found in Braneon et al., 
(2024). Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests results reveal that there is no statistically significant difference at the significance 
level of 0.01 for any of the metric distributions when the three GCMs with TCR values greater than 2.2 degrees C are 
removed (See Table 1 for 2080s results). NPCC4 affirms the temperature and precipitation projections presented 
here (and also in Section 6.4 of (Braneon et al., 2024) as projections of record for the City of New York. See 
Appendix A for boxplots comparing 960-member ensembles (16 GCMs x 2 scenarios x 30 years) of annual 
projections with 780-member ensembles (13 GCMs x 2 scenarios x 30 years) that exclude GCMs with TCR values 
greater than 2.2 degrees C.

projections) for the 2080s with a 26-member ensemble (13 GCMs x 2 scenarios) that excludes GCMs with TCR values greater than 
2.2 degrees C. No statistically significant differences are found for any metric at the 0.01 level. 
 
 
5 To indicate the potential impact of deeply uncertain ice sheet processes, about which there is currently a low level of agreement 
and limited evidence, low confidence projections are also provided for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. For both the Greenland and 
Antarctic ice sheets, the low confidence projections integrate information from the Structured Expert Judgement study of Bamber et 
al. (2019). For the Antarctic ice sheet, the low confidence projections> projections also incorporate results from a simulation study 
that incorporates Marine Ice Cliff Instability (DeConto et al., 2021).

Temperature trends and projections  
Annual average air temperatures, as measured by long-term ground stations in the Global Historical Climatological 
Network – daily (GHCN-daily) (Menne et al., 2012) have increased at stations across the NYC metropolitan area over 
the last 70 years. Although the data records' length varies between stations, the warming rates are similar. During 
their overlapping period of observations (1949-2022), annual mean temperatures have increased at rates between 
0.24°F to 0.41°F per decade (Figure 3) for the period where observations overlap across the stations. This increasing 
trend can be observed across the entire observation record of each station, with Central Park temperatures growing 
at a pace of 0.28°F per decade since 1870. Both daily minimum and maximum temperatures have increased 
throughout this period (Figure 4). In general, nighttime minimum temperatures have increased at faster rates than 
daytime maximum, except at John F Kennedy (JFK) Airport. As in annual average temperatures, similar trends are 
observed in both daily minima and maxima when the records are extended beyond their temporal overlap, with 
Central Park station daily minimum and maximum growing by .26 and .31 °F per decade since the first observations 
in 1870.

Climate change is extremely likely to bring warmer temperatures to the New York metropolitan region. Global climate 
models predict mean annual average temperatures increases between 2.7 to 3.9°F by the 2030s, 4.0 to 6.0°F by the 
2050s, and 5.6 to 9.8 °F by the 2080s relative to a baseline period of 1981 to 2010. The total number of hot days and 
nights in NYC is projected to increase between 15 to 52 days by midcentury. The frequency of heat waves is 
expected to increase by a factor of 2 to 4 times the current baseline, with their average duration increasing by up to 
50% by the 2050s. By the 2080s, the projected number of days per year with maximum temperatures at or above 82 
degrees F (which occur on average 69 days per year in the current climate) nearly doubles. By the 2080s, the upper 
end of projected number of days per year with minimum temperatures at or above 80 degrees F (which occur on 
average about 1 day per year in the current climate) increases 10-fold. 
3.1.6 
Heat index projections 
In order to maintain biological function, humans must keep a body temperature of close to 37°C (98.6°F). However, 
humans gain heat through a variety of mechanisms such as metabolic activity and from interactions with the 
environment. In order to maintain body temperatures near 37°C, the human body sheds heat via convection, 
evaporation of surface sweat, and respiration. Of these, evaporation is most important as it accounts for close to 75% 
of heat dissipation (Koppe et al., 2004). However, evaporation of surface skin sweat is dependent on the properties of 
moist ambient air. As ambient air around a person becomes saturated with moisture, evaporation becomes more 
difficult, leading to reduced heat dissipation. This reduced cooling capacity can be particularly dangerous during 
periods of extreme heat, when humans are most reliant on evaporation for shedding heat.

Although there are several methods to quantify the impact of combined temperatures and humidity on human 
wellbeing, the United States National Weather Service (US NWS) relies on the heat index as defined by Steadman 
(1979) and codified into an equation by Rothfusz (1990)6. 
Table 2 shows the baseline (1981-2010) and projected changes to the occurrence of extreme heat index days 
throughout the 21st century. In the recent historical record, NYC experiences, on average, 38 and 6 days with heat 
index above 85°F and 95°F, respectively. These heat index thresholds are labeled by the US NWS as periods where 
Caution and Extreme Caution are warranted. By mid-century (2050s), the number of heat days with heat index larger 
than 95°F are projected to increase sixfold to 37. (the 50th percentile value of the model-based projections). 
Meanwhile, end of century days with heat index above 95°F increase close to a factor of 9 (50th percentile).  
These results build on work presented in NPCC3 (González et al., 2019) by introducing a full set of projections of 
record of compound humid heat occurrence for the first time in NPCC. These projections leverage sub-daily data 
from CMIP6 and the quantile mapping method used for the other projections on model air temperatures and relative 
humidity estimates to present data consistent with projections of temperature, precipitation, and their extremes.

Precipitation trends and projections 
Annual precipitation has increased since 1959, as recorded across all three long-term weather stations in NYC. The 
Central Park and LaGuardia stations exhibit similar statistically significant positive trends of 1.61 and 1.35 inches 
 
 
6 A recent study by Lu and Romps (2022) found that the NWS formula used to calculate heat index may lead to negative biases 
when applied to future climate scenarios. This paper was not available at the time when the climate projections were updated.

more rain per decade. Meanwhile rainfall at JFK airport station exhibits a slightly lower and not statistically significant 
trend of 0.93 inches more rain per decade.  
Total annual precipitation will likely increase, although precipitation projections are less certain than temperature 
projections. Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase by approximately 2 to 7 percent by the 2030s, 4 to 11 
percent by the 2050s and 7 to 17 percent by the 2080s relative to a baseline period of 1981 to 2010. The frequency 
of extreme precipitation days is projected to increase, with approximately one and a half times more events per year 
possible by the 2080s compared to the current climate (i.e. compared to the 1981 to 2010 baseline period).

New analyses of historical trends and future projection for subdaily precipitation 
Along with changes in annual precipitation, climate change will impact patterns of precipitation at subdaily time scales 
with implications for flooding, harbor water quality, as well as the design and maintenance of building systems and 
infrastructure. To evaluate historic trends in subdaily precipitation, a 68-year study of historical precipitation was 
conducted using hourly precipitation data from The NCEI Hourly Precipitation Dataset (HPCP; 1955-2013) (National 
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), 2023a) and Local Climatological Dataset (LCD; ID NCEI DSI 3505; 
NCEI 2005; 2014-2022) (National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), 2023b). The analysis included three 
NYC metropolitan area gages (Central Park, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Airport), with JFK Airport excluded due 
to long periods of missing hourly data.  
During this period record, it should be noted that the observing technology used transitioned. Unshielded Universal 
(or Freiz) weighing rain gages were in use during the earliest part of each station’s record.  A tipping-bucket type rain 
gage was used at Central Park from 2000-2004, at LaGuardia from 1996-2004 and at Newark from (2000-2005).

These transitioned to an NWS all-weather precipitation accumulation gage in the later part of the record.  Wind 
shielding was added to the gage at LaGuardia in 2010 and Newark in 2019. It is likely that rainfall measured by the 
tipping bucket gages was underestimated, especially when intensity was high. The addition of wind shields likely 
resulted in a more accurate rainfall measurement.  Although these potential biases are an artifact of the entire U.S. 
national hourly precipitation record, established methods to adjust for these discontinuities are not available. 
For these analyses, discrete events were defined by at least a 4-hour period without rainfall (Restrepo-Posada & 
Eagleson, 1982; Yu et al., 2018) and characterized in terms of the peak hourly intensity observed during the event, 
the event total accumulation, the event duration, and the average intensity (defined as event total 
accumulation/duration). The number of events that occurred for each year and each gauge were computed and 
extreme precipitation events, defined as the number of exceedances of the 95th and 99th percentile values in the full 
record, were identified. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed (Hussain & Mahmud, 2019). This test 
was used to identify statistically significant upward and downward trends using a p-value threshold of 0.05. The 
results from these analyses are summarized in Table 3. Significant increasing trends in the 95th percentile peak 
hourly intensity and event total intensity were observed at all 3 sites.

Urban stormwater and other critical infrastructure systems are designed to withstand a defined intensity and duration 
of rainfall, known as the ‘design storm’. For any given rain event, the intensity of rainfall (defined as rainfall depth over 
a given duration) is associated with an annual probability of occurrence, usually described by its reciprocal return 
period. Accurate representation of the probability of rainfall intensity is thus critical for stormwater management and 
flood resilience planning and design. This information is presented in site-specific Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) 
curves, developed based on frequency analysis of historic rainfall at specific locations and under the assumption of 
stationarity - the idea that natural systems fluctuate within an envelope of variability that is unchanging with time (Milly 
et al., 2008). With projections of amplified precipitation intensity through the 21st century due to global climate 
change (Allan & Soden, 2008; Fowler et al., 2021; Pfahl et al., 2017), the appropriateness of this approach to urban 
drainage design has recently been called into question (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2022) . 
Two sets of Partial Duration Series (PDS; 1950-1986 and 1986-2022) were constructed separately using hourly 
precipitation data from the sources described above. For each PDS in the array, IDF curves (Figure 6) describing 
rainfall amounts corresponding to annual recurrence probabilities of 50%, 20%, 10%, 4%, 2% and 1% (i.e. 2-, 5-, 10-

25-, 50- and 100-year storms) were computed by simulating the methodology used in NOAA Atlas 14 (Perica et al., 
2019).  As shown in Figure 6, changes between the 1950-1986 and the 1986-2022 IDF curves vary with rain event 
duration and recurrence probability, with substantially greater changes observed for the 1-12 hour events at 
recurrence intervals greater than 25-years. For example, at the Central Park weather station (Figure 6), the 50-yr 
return period the change in the 1-hour duration is 40%, while for the 24-hr duration rain event it is only 15%.

3.1.9 
Sea level rise projections  
Sea level rise (SLR) in NYC is projected to continue to exceed the global average and is very likely to accelerate as 
the century progresses. A recent study based on statistics and oceanographic data warns of a potential collapse of 
the AMOC an important branch of the global ocean circulation system, as early as the 2050s under current 
greenhouse gas emissions (Ditlevsen & Ditlevsen, 2023). Most experts only anticipate a future slowing of the AMOC 
as opposed to a complete collapse (Liu et al., 2020);  a weakening of the AMOC could lead to increased thermal 
expansion, and redistribution of ocean water mass shoreward especially in the mid-Atlantic region, including New 
York City (Krasting et al., 2016; Yin & Goddard, 2013), as well as increased frequency of coastal flooding in the 
Southeast U.S. (Volkov et al., 2023). 
Projections for SLR in NYC are 14 to 19 inches (0.36-0.48 m) by the 2050s and 25 to 39 inches (0.64-0.99 m) by the 
2080s when compared with a 1995 to 2014 baseline period; SLR could reach as high as 5 feet (1.5 m) by 2100. Full 
details of the methods used to develop these projections with the scenarios shown in Figure 7(2023) can be found in 
Braneon et al., (2024). Under the ARIM scenario presented in 2019 by NPCC3, accelerated loss of land-based ice 
could lead to sea level rise of up to 81 inches (2 m) by the 2080s and 114 inches (2.9 m) by 2100 under a plausible 
‘worst-case’ scenario that cannot entirely be ruled out.

4 Drivers of Extreme Heat 
4.1 
Large-scale Drivers 
Extreme heat in NYC is driven both by large scale climate processes and local characteristics of its land cover. At the 
large scale studies show that that changes in global mean temperatures have led to an increase in the frequency, 
intensity, and duration of extreme heat events (Coumou & Robinson, 2013; Habeeb et al., 2015). A review of global 
drivers of extreme heat by Horton et al (2016) found that several dynamical climate mechanisms impact the 
occurrence and intensity of extreme heat events such as (1) land-atmosphere feedbacks, (2) atmospheric blocking 
events, and (3) planetary-scale atmospheric waves. While there is evidence to support that warmer climates may 
enhance land-atmosphere feedbacks and their impact on heat extremes, there are still open questions on the other 
aforementioned mechanisms’ sensitivity to global climate change. 
There is evidence, however, of increasing trends in large scale circulations linked to extreme heat as a result of 
global climate change. Horton et al (2015) found increasing trends over North America in the occurrence of warm 
season atmospheric blocking, often dubbed heat domes for their warm air trapping effect, finding that increases in 
temperature extremes are impacted not only by thermodynamic changes but also increased incidence of regional 
flow regimes. Climate models, however, may have biases in their representation of the incidence of these large-scale 
flows, which may lead to uncertainties in future projections of extreme heat (Jeong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, evidence 
from extreme heat events in Europe indicates that the cooling capacity of soil moisture through evaporation may be 
depleted by high temperatures, which in turn allows for even higher temperatures due to lack of cooling – a positive 
feedback loop (Miralles et al., 2014). Nevertheless, increased temperatures, including in NYC, are one of the 
strongest signals in climate projections as a function of increasing greenhouse gas emissions (Calvin et al., 2023). 
 
4.2 
Local Drivers 
Local landcover characteristics drive surface and air temperature in the urban built and natural environment. The 
urban built infrastructure refers to streets, sidewalks, and buildings and is primarily comprised of impervious surfaces 
of varying material types, reflectance, and thermal capacities. Throughout the day these surfaces retain, store, and 
emit heat from incoming solar radiation. The rate and magnitude at which the built infrastructure transfers heat 
impacts the surrounding air and surface temperature of the environment. For example, surfaces that have a low 
albedo or reflectivity (e.g. asphalt streets) typically absorb and store more heat during the day releasing it slowly as

17 
sensible heat in the afternoon (Oke, 1982). The release of sensible heat warms the surrounding environment. The 
installation of impervious surfaces in an urban environment such as NYC can also limit natural cooling processes 
such as evaporation, evapotranspiration and wind speed and direction (Mallen et al., 2020). Tall buildings can create 
an “urban canyon” effect that can prevent ventilation and trap heat (Oke, 1982). Anthropogenic heat from human 
activity like traffic, industrial processes and air conditioning is an additional source of heat commonly found in the 
urban environment which can elevate urban air temperature (Oke, 1982). The natural environment is mainly 
comprised of pervious surfaces characterized by vegetation like shrubs, grasses, and trees. Vegetation cools the 
environment through shade and evapotranspiration. The natural environment stores less heat during the day and 
releases heat at a faster rate than the built environment. 
The urban and natural environment store and retain heat from incoming solar radiation throughout the day and 
commence releasing heat as the sets in the afternoon. The slower release of heat from the built environment creates 
a temperature differential with areas containing more of the natural environment creating a phenomenon called the 
urban heat island (UHI) (McConnell et al., 2022) effect characterized by an urban heat island intensity (UHII) (Memon 
et al., 2009). The UHII is traditionally reported as a temperature difference between the urban and surrounding rural 
environment. The highest UHII is commonly observed during the late afternoon through nighttime period. In recent 
years other characterizations of UHII have been used in literature (Almeida et al., 2021; Wang, 2022) as a 
comparison to include parks (Cai et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022), airports (Gough & Leung, 2022; Wan et al., 2022) 
and land classification zones (Zhou et al., 2020). In NYC neighborhoods contain varying amounts of the built and 
natural infrastructure causing some neighborhoods to maintain warmer temperatures (Hamstead et al., 2016). 
Equitable heat mitigation and adaptation policies seek to reduce neighborhood temperature heterogeneity, while 
reducing local citywide temperature (Broadbent et al., 2022; Heger, 2022; Shi et al., 2023).  
UHII in NYC has been studied for several decades, with observations of urban-rural temperature differences of 
3.22°F on average and as high as 5.4°F reported by (Bornstein, 1968). More recent observations based on longer 
study periods found that the NYC UHII averaged between 4°C in the summer and 5.4°C in the winter and spring, with 
significant variability due to the time of day and prevalent weather conditions (Gedzelman et al., 2003).  
The spatial distribution of the NYC UHI is linked to both characteristics of the land surface and larger scale prevailing 
wind conditions (Raven et al., 2022). The NYC UHI is impacted significantly by afternoon sea breezes, which move 
its core inland towards The Bronx and New Jersey in the afternoon, while nighttime land breezes may move its core 
over Brooklyn and Queens. Studies have found that contributions from NYC’s built surface varied significantly due to 
the characteristics of the urban surface as well as distance to the southeastern coastline where sea-breezes typically 
come from, and that these contributions extended several hundred meters above ground (Bauer, 2020; Ortiz et al., 
2018).   
Studies have quantified the impacts of landcover on air temperature in the urban environment. Characteristics of the 
built environment are more closely associated with nighttime air temperature variance compared to daytime air 
temperature (Alonzo et al., 2021; Shiflett et al., 2017; Zekar et al., 2023; Ziter et al., 2019). Minimum (nighttime) air 
temperature is influenced by building height (Chen et al., 2020; Konarska et al., 2016). Research using land use 
regression modeling have observed a non-linear relationship between temperature and canopy cover and greenness, 
requiring a threshold of canopy cover associated with decreases in air temperature, and with diminished cooling as 
distance increases from tree canopied areas (Johnson et al., 2020; Ziter et al., 2019). Decreases in nighttime 
temperatures were found to be associated with a 32% threshold in a 200 m buffer (Johnson et al., 2020) and a 
greater than 40% threshold in a 60-90m buffer (Ziter et al., 2019). 
The relationship between urban land cover (i.e. tree canopy, building height/area, impervious land cover) and 
temperature is made more complex by intra and inter-variability based on the time of day (Raven et al., 2022). 
Pedestrian (ground) level air temperature monitoring offers a means to observer hyper-local variability to assess and 
explore microscale interactions between land cover and temperature, which can lead to changes in how humans 
interact with the environment thus impacting day-to-day human health.

BOX 1. Temperature monitoring in NYC 
In 2018 as a part of Cool Neighborhoods NYC, a comprehensive heat adaptation and mitigation plan (City of New York Mayor’s 
Office of Resiliency, 2017), the city launched a 2-year hyper-local temperature monitoring effort installing nearly 500 air temperature 
sensors in medium to high HVI neighborhoods (see Braneon et al. (2024), Figure 11, for HVI distribution map (2024). These HVI 
neighborhoods were identified based on the prevalence of vegetative cover, air conditioning and demographic prevalence, daytime 
surface temperature, median income, and demographic prevalence. Intra (within) site variability in NYC med-high neighborhoods 
was observed to be larger during the afternoon when UHII is highest compared to the nighttime (Figure 8a). In contrast inter 
(between)-site (between sites) variability is higher at night compared to the afternoon. The magnitude of temperature variability is 
larger for observations representing higher temperature ranges for the afternoon and nighttime periods (Figure 8b). The site with 
the highest afternoon variability is Central Harlem, Manhattan adjacent to Marcus Garvey Park. The lowest variability was observed 
in Stuyvesant Heights Brooklyn. Reducing intra and inter neighborhood variability is important when considering equitable heat 
adaptation and mitigation policies within NYC communities. The thresholds used were based on the 2023 NYC Heat mortality report 
prepared by the NYC Department of Health (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023).

BOX 2. Interactions between heat waves and UHIs 
UHIs are the product of dynamical interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, as well as urban planning decisions 
that dictate the form and material properties of urban landscapes. There is significant evidence of UHI intensification during periods 
of extreme heat due to so-called synergistic interactions (Li & Bou-Zeid, 2013). These synergies arise due to (1) the impact of 
extreme heat on soil moisture availability, which significantly affects the ability of the surface to cool via evapotranspiration, as well 
as (2) increased intake of heat in built-up surfaces. Studies have found these synergies to also occur in NYC (Figure 9) from Ortiz et 
al., (2018), with UHI intensification of over 5°C during a heat wave due to limited cooling and enhanced heat storage (Ortiz et al., 
2018; Ramamurthy et al., 2017).

5 Tail Risk Implications and Challenges 
Low-probability extreme weather and climate change scenarios that have high consequences are referred to as “tail 
risk”. When assessing the risks associated with natural hazards and climate change, tail risks (i.e. low-probability 
extreme events) often play a much larger role than the probability of climate hazards alone might indicate (Quiggin, 
2018). Tail risk is important to quantify, as it entails low-probability scenarios that have high consequences.  
Tail risk for extreme weather is often underestimated because the historical record is insufficient to include a good 
characterization of extreme events. Tail risk for climate projections is often not revealed, due to a focus on the 
scenarios with moderate greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., SSP2-4.5) or by considering 90th percentiles as worst-
case scenarios. Uncertainties in tail risk need to be reduced through deeper exploration of historical data, modeling of 
synthetic events, and climate downscaling simulations. When assessing extreme flooding, tail risk can also be 
reduced by more careful extreme value assessment that explores separation of tropical cyclone event data from other 
events.  
Underestimating tail risk can lead to repeatedly being caught by surprise by events like Sandy and Ida and potentially 
other hazards such as extreme winds. Climate change impacts can have high tail risk, such as the ARIM scenario. 
Baseline (present-day) hazards can also have high tail risk, such as events like Hurricane Sandy. Sandy can be 
considered more of a baseline hazard, given that a similar storm surge had occurred in the historical record in 1821 
(Orton et al., 2016) and research has only found anthropogenic climate change to have contributed to 13% (7.5-23%) 
of the damages (Strauss et al., 2021). However, FEMA and NOAA assessments of extreme coastal water levels at

the time of Sandy’s impact suggested it was a very unlikely event with a 1570-year return period (Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, 2007; Sweet et al., 2013). Reasons why the tail risk of extreme events such as Sandy and Ida 
could be underestimated are revealed below. 
5.1 
Extreme Precipitation Implications 
The most direct mechanism of precipitation intensification results from the thermodynamic relationship between 
atmospheric temperature and the saturation vapor pressure of water, which is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) 
Relation (‘warmer air holds more moisture'). Under the temperature conditions relevant to weather, the amount of 
water vapor in the atmosphere at saturation will increase 6-7% per degree Celsius warming. From this 
thermodynamic relationship alone, it would be expected that precipitation would occur less frequently when the 
supply of atmospheric moisture is limited, since more moisture would be required for the atmosphere to reach 
saturation, condense, and precipitate. However, when large-scale weather conditions provide a source of 
atmospheric moisture, there would be more precipitable water and, in turn, higher rainfall rates once saturation is 
reached (Trenberth et al., 2003). 
Along with this direct thermodynamic effect, climate change can also influence short-duration precipitation extremes 
through several key atmospheric processes that take place at micro- to global spatial scales. At a global scale, a 
fundamental effect of global warming will be the thermal expansion of the warming troposphere and stratospheric 
cooling, resulting in an increase in the height of the tropopause. Increased tropospheric heights will allow for deeper 
convection and increased precipitation rates when local conditions are favorable (Lenderink et al., 2017; Loriaux et 
al., 2017; Santer et al., 2003).  
Global warming can also influence precipitation patterns through changes in the continental-scale atmospheric 
circulation patterns that determine the transport of moisture across the globe. In the eastern United States, the 
climatology of large-scale moisture transport can be described by 16 spatially distinct atmospheric transport patterns, 
each with a distinct frequency and seasonality (Teale & Robinson, 2020). Anthropogenic climate change could 
potentially alter the frequency or seasonality of these patterns, with implications for local moisture availability and the 
probability of extreme precipitation in the future. 
Large scale patterns associated with tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions, and hurricanes) also play an 
important role in the climatology of extreme precipitation in the northeast. This includes events associated with direct 
rainfall from tropical cyclones passing over, or very close to NYC. It also includes extreme rainfall that results from the 
remnants of tropical storms, such as the cloudburst associated with the remnants of Hurricane Ida in 2021, or 
changes to atmospheric dynamics such as lifting, instability, or moisture availability induced by tropical cyclones 
hundreds of kilometers away (Barlow, 2011). 
In an observational analysis study of the continental United States, Barlow (2011) found that over most of the 
Northeast, more than two‐thirds of all extreme daily rainfall events between 1975 and 1999 were linked to tropical 
cyclone‐related activity. In terms of the dynamics underlying the forcing of extreme precipitation, Barlow’s study found 
that the relationship between tropical cyclones or their remnants on large-scale lift was much greater than the 
relationship with moisture availability and buoyancy. It recommended further study of the interactions of tropical 
cyclones with large-scale circulation patterns that induce lift, such as the jet stream. This is notable, since large-scale 
lift induced by a powerful jet streak and associated upper-level divergence was a key contributor to the extremely 
intense precipitation observed during the Ida-remnants cloudburst in NYC in 2021 (National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, 2023b, fig. 4). 
The influence of climate change on mesoscale storm processes also has the potential to result in more intense short-
duration precipitation. Convective precipitation can occur in isolated thunderstorm cells or as part of organized 
clusters described as Mesoscale (10s to 100s of kilometers) Convective Systems (MCSs), which are often embedded 
into larger scale circulation such as squall lines or Nor'Easters. Organized convection is associated with increased 
precipitation efficiency - the ratio of moisture that falls to the surface as precipitation to total condensed moisture 
within a storm - and more intense precipitation (Fowler et al., 2021). Mosely et al. (2016) found that increased surface 
temperatures resulted in enhanced convective organization and more extreme precipitation and that, more broadly, 
the interactions amongst convective cells could be strongly influenced by large-scale changes in climate.  
Historically, flash flooding in the northeast has been more commonly associated with disorganized, localized 
convective cells rather than organized MCSs, especially when compared to other regions of the United States 
(Jessup & Colucci, 2012). The significance of potential changes in convective organization in more extreme 
precipitation with climate change remains uncertain and is still in early stages of investigation (Pendergrass, 2020), 
however, some initial studies indicate that the storm areas may be larger and more organized under climate warming 
(Lenderink et al., 2017; Lochbihler et al., 2019). In a climate modeling study simulating an unmitigated global warming

21 
scenario (RCP 8.5), Prein et al. (2017) found that the total volume of summertime precipitation increased with global 
warming due to both increased precipitation rates and increases in the area over which precipitation occurs in 
organized MCSs. 
Within individual thunderstorms, the increased moisture from warmer temperatures will increase the release of latent 
heat, creating more instability and stronger updrafts within thunderstorms and increasing precipitation rates beyond 
what would be expected from the increase in moisture availability alone. Assuming that latent heat within a 
thunderstorm is proportional to precipitation intensity and that kinetic energy of rising air within a thunderstorm 
increases proportionally with latent heating, precipitation intensity would be expected to increase at a rate twice that 
predicted by the CC relationship alone (2CC-scaling (Lenderink et al., 2017). 
Changes in microphysical dynamics within thunderstorm clouds can also influence precipitation efficiency and 
convective precipitation rates. Precipitation efficiency is determined by the size distribution of hydrometeors (water 
and ice droplets) within thunderstorm clouds and the extent to which these hydrometeors re-evaporate or are re-
entrained in updrafts before falling as precipitation to the ground. Singh and O’Gorman (2015) found that climatic 
warming resulted in an increase in the fall speed of water and ice droplets within clouds. Higher fall speeds reduce 
the probability that a water droplet will evaporate or be reëntrained in updrafts within the thunderstorm, resulting in 
higher precipitation efficiency within any given storm. However, the fall speed of water droplets within clouds can also 
influence updraft velocities, and in-turn precipitation rates (Bao & Sherwood, 2019; Parodi & Emanuel, 2009). 
Understanding the changes in these microphysical processes are most significant for sub-hourly precipitation rates 
(Singh & O’Gorman, 2015): studies on the contribution of tropical cyclones to subdaily rainfall in the New York City 
Metropolitan region are not yet available in the academic literature. 
5.2 
Sea Level Rise Implications 
A key remaining uncertainty around the tail risk of future sea level rise is the future stability of the ice sheets and the 
Antarctic Ice Sheet as it holds the equivalent of 58.3 m of global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) if all its ice melted. 
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is potentially subject to two instabilities: the Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) 
and Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) (Braneon et al., 2024, section 4.1.1). Therefore, in NPCC3, Gornitz et al. (2019) 
also considered one high end, low probability scenario—ARIM scenario, which includes these potential instabilities. 
DeConto et al. (2021), in a revised extreme upper tail GMSLR scenario which also includes these instabilities, found 
that by 2025, the median contribution of the WAIS to GMSL approaches 1 m and by 2150 rates exceed 6 cm. By 
2300, Antarctica could contribute 9.6 m of GMSLR under RCP8.5 due to sustained CO2 emissions increases that 
extend past 2100.  
A new study finds that projected 21st century ocean temperature increases in the Amundsen Sea region of WAIS 
point to inevitable widespread basal ice shelf thinning and melting in most greenhouse gas emissions scenarios 
(Naughten et al., 2023). With weakened ice shelf buttressing, accelerated rates of ice-shelf melting would become 
inevitable even for moderate future climate policies, with adverse implications for the stability of WAIS. 
The Greenland Ice Sheet, which holds the equivalent of 7 meters of sea level rise is also potentially vulnerable to 
abrupt ice-sheet loss beyond a global mean temperature threshold of 1.7 °C to 2.3 °C above preindustrial levels 
(Bochow et al., 2023). This ice loss can be substantially reduced if global mean temperature change reverts to less 
than 1.5°C above preindustrial levels within a few centuries. Nevertheless, even temporarily overshooting the 1.5°C 
temperature threshold, still leads to a peak in SLR of up to several meters even if ice sheets return to nearly historical 
normals.  
5.3 
Potential Mischaracterization of Tail Risk from Tropical Cyclones 
A fundamental challenge with storm-related hazard assessments for the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Southern New 
England is that Tropical Cyclones (TCs) (defined as including hybrid storms and post-TCs) are responsible for the 
largest events (e.g. Sandy and Ida) but occur infrequently during the typical detailed observation record (e.g. 75 years 
for hourly rainfall data from 1948-2022). Therefore, TC hazard data are typically under-sampled, leading to difficulty in 
constructing extreme value distributions. As a result, despite large differences in TC and extratropical cyclone (ETC) 
maximum storm intensities judged by pressure drop or maximum sustained wind speed, observation-based 
assessments of surge, wind and rain hazards typically merge data from TCs with far more numerous data from ETCs.  
An alternative solution to this problem has been model-based assessments that create synthetic TC events to enable 
separate extreme value analyses of TCs and ETCs (e.g. Gori et al., 2022; Orton et al., 2016). For the NYC area, 
these model-based assessments that separate data by storm type have at times found substantially higher estimates 
of water level extremes (Cialone et al., 2015; Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2014; Orton et al., 2016). 
However, such model-based hazard-assessments have a high epistemic uncertainty and are challenging to 
independently validate. This approach has rarely (or never) been applied for wind and rain hazard assessments for

NYC, which have continued to use merged observational data, potentially underestimating the baseline natural 
hazards and societal “tail risk”.  
A recent analysis is summarized here that evaluates the differences between merged and separate extreme value 
analyses for TC and ETC storm tides (McPherson et al. 2024, section 2.9). Storm tide return level data are created 
for a range of US Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Coast TC and ETC coastal storm tide climates (e.g. Lin et al. 2012; 
Orton et al. 2016; Dullart et al. 2021). The TC peak storm tide exceedance curves follow the Gumbel distribution with 
a range of nine different slopes.  A single ETC peak storm tide exceedance probability curve is utilized based on the 
Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution that represents water level extremes for NY Bight and southern New 
England (e.g. Orton et al., 2016; Dullart et al., 2021).  
Stochastic storm tide event sets for TCs and ETCs are created by sampling from these distributions to create 
synthetic historical periods of 100 years, similar to that available from NOAA for New York City at the Battery tide 
gauge. One thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed for each storm tide climate and Extreme Value Analysis 
(EVA) is applied to each synthetic historical period. In each simulation, EVA is performed on both merged versus 
separated TC and ETC populations, and the results are compared. Three analysis methods are utilized -- (1) fitting 
combined TC/ETC datasets annual maximum storm tide (AMST) with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions 
as has recently been standard practice (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2023a; Sweet et al., 
2013); (2) Using a peaks-over-threshold approach and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) with mixed ETC and 
TC events, as done in many hazard assessment types (e.g. Atlas-14; others), and (3) Using approach #1 for ETC 
and #2 for fitting TC storm tide distributions.  
 
Figure 10. Results of a series of Monte Carlo simulations of Extreme Value Analyses of estimated 100-year storm tides for synthetic 
data for 100-year datasets, across a range of environments with different a priori known 100-year storm tides. EVA approaches 
studied include (left) GEV distribution fitting of mixed data, (middle) GPD distribution of mixed data, and (right) separated TC and 
ETC distribution fitting. Error bars show 90% variability ranges of the results. 
Results show that fitting GEV distribution to AMST from mixed storm tide populations often leads to underestimated 
100-year storm tides (Figure 10 left panel). The GPD approach greatly reduces the low bias (middle panel), but the 
GPD focus only on the tail of the distribution tail raises the uncertainty higher than that for separated EVA. The 
separate analysis of TCs and ETCs has moderate uncertainty but minimizes the low bias (right panel).  
The results of these analyses demonstrate some of the challenges of quantifying tail risk. Small numbers of extreme 
events that predominantly come from TCs lead to either low bias or high uncertainty in estimated 100-year extremes, 
illustrated in Figure 10. These same challenges likely apply to storm surge, wind and rainfall, and separated EVA 
should be explored for all these coastal storm related hazards. These challenges point to the importance of not over-
relying on quantitative projections, given deep uncertainties and limitations to model based projections; more 
qualitative approaches, grounded in decision making under uncertainty, are likely to be instructive for these and other 
uncertainties described in this chapter and throughout this report. 
5.4 
Limitations Associated with GCM Resolution and Downscaling Methods 
Many recent studies (DeGaetano & Castellano, 2017; Kunkel et al., 2020; Miro et al., 2021; National Weather 
Service, 2022) have employed a quantile delta approach to develop climate-change informed IDF curves. Quantiles

23 
are discrete segments within a probability distribution, in this context corresponding with the recurrence intervals 
associated with IDF curves of a given duration (Miro et al., 2021). The ensemble of downscaled GCM outputs are 
used to calculate delta change factors, the relative change between the present and the future precipitation frequency 
estimates for each quantile.  The delta change factors between historic and future values are calculated separately 
for each quantile within the IDF probability distribution. This approach is quasi-stationary, with constant delta change 
factors applied for each future time interval. Time intervals are typically 30 years or more, allowing for representation 
of multidecadal climate conditions. The delta change factors are then used to adjust IDF curves based on past 
observations so that they represent future non-stationary climate. 
A key advantage of applying the quantile delta change method to calculate the rate of increase of future estimates is 
that the inherited bias of the climate model data is reduced when applied as ratios. These rates of increase of the 
future estimates can be applied along with the current period, which is based on more reliable spatial and temporal 
characteristics of the historical observations (National Weather Service, 2022). Also, with this approach, the relative 
changes in all modeled quantiles are accounted for rather than only relative changes in the modeled mean (Cannon 
et al., 2015).Future intensity duration frequency (IDF) curves were generated using downscaled precipitation data 
from the Localized Constructed Analogs version 1 (LOCA1) (Pierce et al., 2014) and version 2 (LOCA2) (Pierce et al., 
2023) and compared.  An ensemble of 21 CMIP5 GCM models is the basis of the LOCA1 dataset, while 27 CMIP6 
GCM models, with up to ten of their ensemble members, are used in LOCA2.  Only a single downscaling method was 
considered given LOCA2 was the only available downscaled CMIP6 dataset available at the time, and due to the 
desire to reflect data used in the U.S. National Climate Assessment. The two main differences between LOCA1 and 
LOCA2 are the input GCM data and the precipitation training data - LOCA1 downscaled CMIP5 model outputs 
whereas LOCA2 downscaled the CMIP6 models' outputs to generate high resolution (6km) future projections of 
precipitation. LOCA1 used an observational dataset from (Livneh et al., 2015). However, additional analyses on this 
dataset discovered a bias in the strength of daily rain extremes which resulted in unrealistically weak values (Pierce 
et al., 2023). LOCA2 uses Pierce et al. (2021), which is believed to correct the bias seen in (Livneh et al., 2015) and 
better represent daily rain extremes (Pierce et al., 2023). Differences in downscaling methodology including the 
observational data used in bias correction, are a source of uncertainty in the resulting projections.  Maimone et al. 
(2023) examined the influence of such uncertainty and concluded that despite differences associated with various 
approaches (including the method used here) the range of future extreme rainfall projections was comparable and 
provided practical planning-level data. 
Overall, a total of six GCM experiments were analyzed. For CMIP5, the historical period covers 1950-2005. Its future 
climates are based on the representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios that represent medium-low 
emissions (RCP4.5) and high emissions (RCP8.5) future climates. For CMIP6, the historical period covers 1950-
2014, and its two future scenarios (2015-2099) under the shared socio-economic pathways (SSP) that represent low 
emission (SSP245) and high emission (SSP585) future climates.  
Across the four stations (Central Park, JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Airport), the extremes seen in 
LOCA2 downscaled CMIP6 projections tend to be larger than those in LOCA1 downscaled CMIP5 values in both the 
lower and high emissions scenarios (Figure 11 b & d). This is particularly evident at the longer return periods. For 
Central Park (which is representative of JFK and LaGuardia), the CMIP6 change factors are similar to those from 
CMIP5 for the 2-yr return period, but for return periods >5 years, the CMIP6 values exceed the 50% confidence 
interval of the CMIP5 (LOCA1) values in the majority of cases (Figure 11 a & b). The results for Newark are similar 
(Figure 11 c & d). Like Central Park, the CMIP6 2-yr return period change factor is marginally lower than that of 
CMIP5, but for the remaining returning periods the CMIP6 values exceed those from CMIP5. However, Newark is the 
only station where all CMIP6 change factors are within the 50% confidence interval of CMIP5 (Figure 11 c&d). It 
should be noted that these differences can arise from both the underlying global climate models as well as the 
differences in methods used in LOCA1 and LOCA2.

The GCMs downscaled to develop the delta change factors are able to represent the dynamics of large-scale 
atmospheric processes and their interactions across the globe. But they are unable to represent the dynamic 
processes described in Section 5.2.1 that take place at finer-spatial scales (Table 4)(Maimone et al., 2019; Yu et al., 
2018). While statistical downscaling provides a means to represent the finer-scale spatial structure of precipitation, it 
is based on historical patterns that may not be representative of future climate. For example, the observed changes in 
annual probability for extreme subdaily precipitation at the Central Park Weather Station are substantially greater 
than those for daily precipitation (Table 3). Such changes may not be represented in current projections based on 
downscaled GCMs if they result from finer-scale processes. 
As an alternative, Convection Permitting Regional Climate Models (CPRCMs) are RCMs run at < 4km spatial 
resolution. At this resolution, deep convection parameterization is no longer required since the convective dynamics 
within rainstorms - and their potential changes with global warming - can be explicitly simulated (Kendon et al., 2017). 
In addition, these models are better able to represent details of the land surface, which might be particularly important 
in highly urbanized areas like New York City (Luo et al., 2022; Luong et al., 2020). But while CPRCMs have the 
potential to provide important insight on how climate change will impact extreme precipitation, no single CPRCM can 
accurately represent future climate on its own and studies utilizing an ensemble of CPRCM outputs are needed to 
generate robust projections for subdaily precipitation (Ban et al., 2021; Pichelli et al., 2021).  The computational 
expense of CPCRM remains a challenge and such studies have only been piloted in a small number of regions 
across the world over the last four years (Kendon et al., 2021). At the time of writing, an ensemble of CPCRM 
forecasts needed to conduct such a study is not yet available for NYC.

6 Opportunities for Future Research 
There remain key gaps in the understanding of changing climate risks in NYC. In this section, we present a non-
exhaustive list of research gaps that may inform important impacts of a changing climate in NYC, tied to the topics 
covered here. Additional research gaps related to climate and its changing impacts may be found in Braneon et al. 
(2024). While projections for extreme heat were updated in this chapter, they focused on outdoor conditions as 
modeled by climate models in CMIP6. However, indoor heat exposure remains the most common site for the onset of 
heat related mortality and hospitalizations (Matte et al., 2024). Addressing this gap will need an interdisciplinary 
research agenda that studies not only the physics of the climate systems but also its interactions with human 
infrastructure (e.g., homes, the urban canopy). Another gap related to extreme heat is the lack of spatially explicit 
projections for air temperature. NPCC3 (González et al., 2019) described new methods that could fill this gap using 
methods like dynamical downscaling, but high computational costs and uncertainties around future changes to the 
city’s urban landscape have made robust application prohibitive. Downscaled projections to the neighborhood and 
higher levels could provide invaluable information on the physical interactions between a changing climate and the 
unjust distribution of heat-resilient spaces that lead to inequitable exposure to extreme heat in cities like NYC due to 
decades (Chakraborty et al., 2019; Foster et al., 2024; Matte et al., 2024; Wilson, 2020). 
Another key gap relates to the treatment of CMIP6 models with ECS outside of the likely range. Although analysis 
presented in this chapter describes the existing differences between the so-called “hot models” and the rest of the 
CMIP6 ensemble, there may be larger scale physical processes that may be poorly constrained in these models. 
Additional research may be needed to better understand the relationships between increased ECS and the frequency 
and intensity of weather extremes in NYC. Moreover, because of the complex nature of the climate system and the

models that try to quantify their processes the causes of enhanced ECS are poorly understood. A research agenda 
that includes out-of-sample tests from paleoclimate records and modeling may provide insights into the constraints 
needed in the next generations of earth systems models (Burls & Sagoo, 2022a). Similarly, data collection on key 
processes related to large scale drivers of climate change and sea-level rise may inform constraints on existing 
models and improve estimation across a range of impacts. As an intermediate solution, future NPCC assessments 
could elect to present projections across global warming levels (e.g., 2°C, 3°C) to avoid some of the potential 
influences from the hot models in the CMIP ensemble.  
7 Traceable Accounts 
Key Message 1  
NPCC4 analysis of the impact of hot models on the CMIP6 ensemble found no statistically significant 
difference between the temperature and precipitation projections of record and alternative projections that 
do not include models with equilibrium climate sensitivity outside the expected range. The CMIP6 climate 
model ensemble used to create the temperature and precipitation projections of record contains three 
models that display higher-than-expected sensitivity of temperatures to greenhouse gases. These so-called 
“hot models” lead to higher global mean temperatures. However, the impact of high climate sensitivity 
appears small with our approach to developing local projections for NYC. Nevertheless, more research is 
needed to better understand (1) the impact of the high climate sensitivity on the representation of key large 
scale climate processes, (2) the model physics leading to high sensitivity in the first place, and (3) the 
constraints on the planet’s equilibrium climate sensitivity. 
Description of 
Evidence 
Many models that make up the CMIP6 experiment and serve as the basis of NPCC projections of record 
are more sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing than previous generations of models, leading to hotter global 
average temperatures (Zelinka et al., 2020). This higher sensitivity is often attributed to stronger positive 
cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo (Zelinka et al., 2020). 
Analysis by NPCC4 found non statistically significant differences between projections of record when hot 
models are removed. 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Although high sensitivity models are still within the likely ECS range as supported by evidence (Masson-
Delmotte et al., 2021), there is evidence from the paleorecord indicating that such high values are 
unrealistic (Zhu et al., 2020). New evidence from paleoclimate records and simulations may be needed to 
better constrain the newer generation of earth system models (Burls & Sagoo, 2022b). 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the analysis performed by NPCC4, there is high confidence that the projections of record presented 
in Braneon et al., (2024)are not significantly impacted by the “hot model problem”. There is medium 
confidence that the representations of all physical process relevant to the climate of NYC are not 
significantly impacted by these high ECS models.

Key Message 2 
The high tail end of sea level rise will be governed by the future stability of the ice sheets, and in particular, 
that of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), with ~3 m of SLR potential if all its marine-based ice melted, 
and also that of the Greenland Ice Sheet (~7 m SLR equivalent). Troubling signs of ice shelf thinning and 
ocean warming around WAIS and an approaching temperature tipping point over Greenland raise the 
possibility of faster and higher sea level rise than projected by most climate models, increasing the risks 
associated with coastal flooding. Additional research is needed to gain a better understanding of all the 
processes governing ice sheet behavior with rising temperatures. Stakeholders concerned with long-term 
planning need to examine plausible scenarios at the extreme upper tail of the sea level rise distribution. 
Description of 
Evidence 
MISI may develop because much of WAIS lies on land below sea level, on reverse slopes that tilt toward 
the continental interior--an inherently unstable topographic configuration. An ice stream or glacier on a 
reverse slope near the grounding line undergoing MISI accelerates, calving more and more ice until the 
bed slope flattens or rises landward (e.g. Figure 3.5 in Gornitz et al., (2019; Milillo et al., 2022). A more 
controversial process is the Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) in which the exposed cliff face of a high ice 
cliff (>100 m (~328 ft) above sea level) may become structurally weakened and collapse after thinning and 
removal of a buttressing ice shelf.  Furthermore, in a warmer climate, larger meltwater pools on top of an 
ice cliff during summer would propagate down crevasses and cut through ice until reaching bottom in a 
process known as hydrofracturing. Ice cliff retreat is accelerated as large ice masses calve. Several 
regions of WAIS face high vulnerability to (Marine Ice Shelf Instability) MISI. In particular, the Thwaites 
Glacier would become “unstoppable” once it passes beyond two ridges (Morlighem et al., 2020). If current 
rates of retreat persist, the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf could unpin from the seafloor in less than a decade. 
The collapse of Thwaites Glacier, which holds the equivalent of more than half a meter of global sea level 
rise potential, could also destabilize neighboring glaciers that hold another 3 m of sea level rise potential. 
Three other glaciers near Thwaites show rapid retreat within the last decade (Milillo et al., 2022). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
A recent study confirms the ongoing rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier’s grounding line, in particular, 
near a pinning point mapped in 2014 (Wild et al., 2022). New underwater surveys of the Thwaites Eastern 
Ice Shelf (TEIS) between 2011 to 2020 also reveal favorable submarine topography that promotes 
enhanced melting near the ice base and entry of warmer ocean water leading to sustained grounding line 
retreat (Schmidt et al., 2023). On the other hand, negative feedbacks, such as glacial rebound or a 
weakened gravitational attraction may mitigate the full extent of MISI (e.g. Barletta et al., 2018; Gomez et 
al., 2015). MICI may be delayed by slower retreat of ice shelves (Clerc et al., 2019), rates and degree of 
effectiveness of hydrofracturing (Robel & Banwell, 2019), and lack of evidence for an observed MICI either 
at present or in the geological past (Edwards et al., 2019).   
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Recent ice sheet observations raise renewed concerns over the long-term stability of both the WAIS and 
Greenland Ice Sheet with continued climate warming. Glaciers and ice sheets combined are now the 
dominant contributors to global mean sea level rise with very high confidence. Further, sea level is 
projected to rise for centuries and remain elevated for thousands of years with very high confidence.

Key Message 3 
While occurrence of extreme heat events in NYC is governed in great part by climatic events taking place 
at large spatial scales, local urbanization patterns play a key role in the spatial distribution of temperatures 
within the city. These local patterns, which include a range of factors like distribution of green spaces and 
urban geometry, play the most significant role in the generation of physical process that lead to the urban 
heat island (UHI). Moreover, extreme heat events exacerbate this intra-urban excess temperatures, 
increasing exposure to deadly heat of populations without access to adaptive measures and cooling 
infrastructure (e.g., cooling centers, tree shade). Future work is needed to assess the impact of a warming 
climate on intra-urban heat variability in order quantify the effect of climate change on spatial inequities of 
heat exposure. 
Description of 
Evidence 
The NYC UHI has been studied for decades, with measurements of urban-rural temperature differences 
going back decades (Bornstein, 1968). There is significant following evidence of the impact of urban 
surfaces on temperatures in NYC, with values often ranging between 0.5 to 5 depending on time of year 
and prevailing weather conditions (Childs & Raman, 2005; Gedzelman et al., 2003). Further, there is 
significant evidence of positive feedbacks between the NYC UHI and extreme heat events (Ortiz et al., 
2018; Ramamurthy et al., 2017).   
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Although most studies have shown intensification of UHIs during extreme heat events, some have found 
no such intensification in the observation record (Scott et al., 2018). Further, there are robust projections 
of intra-urban heat in NYC that account for local physics across model ensembles and climatologically 
relevant temporal scales.   
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the significant modeling and observational evidence, there is very high confidence in the existence 
and magnitude of the NYC UHI. There is also high confidence of synergistic interactions between extreme 
heat and UHIs, although the extent of these interactions remains a topic of research.

Abstract: 
The Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City (Equity) chapter of NPCC4 builds 
on the findings and recommendations from NPCC3 to identify additional metrics and adaptation efforts that can 
advance climate justice. First, the chapter assesses the efforts of the city to incorporate equity into climate adaptation 
efforts since NPCC3 and describes how the communities profiled in NPCC3 have implemented and evolved their 
approaches to addressing the intersecting climate, environmental, and social stressors that they continue to face. 
Second, it adds to the historical context of climate inequity by linking the bioregion’s history of colonization, land 
dispossession, and slavery building on emerging evidence demonstrating how historical and contemporary land use 
patterns and decisions shape present and future climate risks and social vulnerability, including climate displacement. 
Third, it recommends a NYC focused metric to identify areas of the city that are most vulnerable to the intersection of 
climate hazards, social vulnerability, and displacement. Finally, it highlights approaches to more equitable and just 
climate adaptation drawn from local, national, and international examples. As such, the chapter offers best practices 
that prioritize community-driven climate resilience approaches that are integrated, more equitable, and racially just.

New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City 
 Interim Report for Public Release

1 Introduction 
Equity is an essential part of climate adaptation and resilience efforts for cities. The NPCC3 report featured equity 
dimensions of climate adaptation using several metrics and case studies applicable to New York City (NYC). The 
NPCC3 report metrics included well-established social vulnerability indices and a tripartite framing of climate equity 
using distributive, procedural, and contextual concepts. NPCC4 builds on this climate equity approach and expands it 
to reflect the developing literature on climate justice. Climate justice is defined in the IPCC as “[j]ustice that links 
development and human rights to achieve a human-centered approach to addressing climate change, safeguarding 
the rights of the most vulnerable people and sharing the burdens and benefits of climate change and its impacts 
equitably and fairly” (IPCC, 2022). The term implies that climate adaptation and mitigation efforts must account for 
differential impacts and equitable allocation of benefits and burdens that considers drivers of climate change, 
including global economic systems dependent on resource extraction, as well as legacies of colonialism and racism. 
To advance climate justice, NYC must attend to how historical legacies of discrimination and bias drive climate risks 
and unequal vulnerability to those risks. 
1.1 
Key Messages 
Key Message 1: The City's climate-related equity work since 2019 has become more explicitly focused on 
redressing environmental injustice and racial disparities. Over the past five years, the City has embarked on 
four interrelated sets of actions to foster and advance equity in its approach to climate adaptation: (1) adoption of 
multiple laws and programs to address equity issues related to climate change impacts, (2) internal institutional 
reforms in the provision of city services; (3) development of indicators and metrics and digital, interactive, and 
mapping platforms that are publicly accessible to track and monitor city agencies’ progress; and, (4) incorporation of 
equity into ongoing climate risk assessments and in sustainability and resilience planning.    
Key Message 2: The City's climate-related equity work would benefit from more comprehensive data on 
disaggregated climate risks at the local level and tracking of city-sponsored climate adaptation projects and 
resilience investments. There is limited understanding of climate change impacts and adaptation needs at the 
community or neighborhood level and limited systematic data exists on city-sponsored adaptation projects and 
resilience investments. More disaggregated climate risk data and systematic tracking of city-sponsored climate 
investments are needed. 
Key Message 3: Some of the city's most marginalized communities have evolved their approaches to 
combat a variety of environmental, climate, and social stressors.  The organizations profiled in NPCC3's equity 
section report that they are implementing dynamic approaches to address the various risks they face while providing 
multiple benefits to their communities. These benefits include expanding access to solar energy and providing 
upgrades for cooling residences experiencing high heat and air pollution exposure. 
Key Message 4: The climate change challenges that New York City faces are inextricably linked to the 
bioregion’s early history, including slavery and land dispossession. Understanding the impacts of this history is 
vital for formulating effective policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. An appreciation of the 
historical legacy of climate impacts on the region, and on certain communities, also necessitates a commitment to 
reparations and restorative justice. By recognizing Indigenous knowledge, seeking restorative justice, and 
reconceptualizing our relationship to land, the City can forge a future that respects the environment, promotes social 
justice, and ensures the well-being of all communities.  
Key Message 5: Climate risks for the most socially vulnerable populations are linked to both past and 
present land use decisions and patterns and their underlying inequities. Although the relationships between 
historical land use and climate risk are complex and context-dependent, they often have similar underlying 
mechanisms such as past discriminatory land use and siting decisions, redlining and disinvestment, and lower land 
costs in hazard-prone areas. Many of these land use issues—past and present—reinforce one another and create 
future risks and vulnerabilities. Without the creation of climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience policies and 
practices that promote racially equitable procedures and outcomes, the City will risk perpetuating these inequities in 
new forms.

Key Message 6: Climate displacement is an important dimension of social vulnerability to climate change 
and should be measured by the City. The City's ability to measure the risks of climate displacement at an 
appropriate scale, such as at the neighborhood level, could help determine whether and how new  infrastructure or 
infrastructure investments designed to help the city adapt to climate impacts might risk displacement and identify 
ways to mitigate that risk. Use of a combined climate displacement and social vulnerability (CDSV) score is proposed 
to integrate socio-economic, climate risk, and evictions and housing data to better measure the risks of climate 
displacement at the census-tract level.  
Key Message 7: Without anti-displacement strategies in place, resilience-promoting investments can have 
inequitable outcomes.  These strategies require several key approaches: (1) incorporating contextual equity and 
understanding the history of places down to the neighborhood level; (2) taking a holistic approach to reducing 
racialized vulnerability to climate shocks, including inseparable issues like housing and transit access; and, (3) 
recognizing that the cost burdens of climate adaptation (e.g., higher energy costs, insurance premiums, relocation) 
affect people differently—particularly when considered in light of homeownership and wealth gaps—and can result in 
increased displacement risks. 
Key Message 8: Key to achieving equitable climate adaptation is to prioritize community-driven climate 
resilience approaches. As an example of successful approaches, community-based organizations featured in 
NPCC 3 have implemented climate adaptation initiatives that were attentive to the intersecting nature of climate risks 
and other health vulnerabilities, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives include climate mitigation 
strategies and provide multiple benefits including equitable access to renewable energy, affordable and efficient 
housing, and economic development strategies that promote equitable green, adaptation economies. 
Key Message 9: Best practices from around New York City and the world highlight the importance of 
integrated, affirmatively anti-racist, equitable, and just approaches to tackling climate risks. The three broad 
categories of best practices identified for more equitable and racially just climate adaptation approaches are: (1) 
integrative approaches to climate resilience that seek out opportunities to advance just transitions and adaptive 
economies; (2) community-led planning processes that make adaptation plans more successful in the face of 
intersecting housing and climate displacement risks; and, (3) collaborative development of goals, programs, policies 
by leveraging relationships between communities, civic organizations, and state and local government offices and 
programs. 
 
1.2 
Chapter Scope and Context 
The Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City (Equity) chapter builds on the 
findings and recommendations to the City from the NPCC3 equity workgroup to identify additional metrics and 
adaptation efforts that can advance climate justice. The NPCC3 report (Foster et al., 2019) found that social 
vulnerability to climate change stressors is unequally distributed across African American and Hispanic residents. The 
report also found, based on qualitative case studies of communities with high levels of social vulnerability, that those 
communities also face intersecting stressors such as disproportionate pollution exposure and gentrification 
pressures, which are aggravated by climate change impacts (Anguelovski et al., 2019). Finally, the report found that 
these same communities are involved in many forms of adaptation planning and implementation to address this 
intersection of stressors, but that they desire a deeper engagement with the city via the use of fully collaborative, 
coproduction planning approaches.  
Based on these findings, the NPCC3 report recommended to the city actions that would incorporate all forms of 
climate equity—distributional, contextual, and procedural—into its adaptation efforts, particularly if those efforts are 
focused at the neighborhood level.  On the distributional dimension, the report recommended future tracking of social 
vulnerability through index-based methods like the social vulnerability index (SoVI (SoVI® - College of Arts and 
Sciences | University of South Carolina, n.d.) or SVI (CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), 2024)), through 
the use of individual variables, and/or through a combination of approaches. On the contextual dimension, the report 
recommended that the city involve local communities much earlier and more often in adaptation planning to ensure 
that local context and knowledge is appropriately accounted for in that planning. Additionally, the report also 
recommended that adaptation projects should contain a stronger focus on community development to reduce the 
potential of displacing longtime residents and to promote the social sustainability of local communities. For procedural 
equity, the report recommended that city officials work side by side with communities at the outset to co-design and 
co-implement neighborhood-based adaptation projects (Foster et al., 2019).

This Equity chapter builds on those findings and recommendations in the following ways. First, the chapter assesses 
the efforts of the city to incorporate equity into climate adaptation efforts since the NPCC3 report. It also describes 
how the communities profiled in that report have implemented and evolved their approaches to addressing the 
intersecting climate, environmental, and social stressors that they continue to face. Second, the chapter adds to the 
historical context of climate inequity in NYC by linking it to the bioregion’s history of colonization, land dispossession, 
and slavery. The chapter importantly builds on an emerging body of empirical evidence demonstrating how historical 
and contemporary land use patterns and decisions shape present and future climate risks and social vulnerability, 
including climate displacement.  
Third, to better respond to the ways that history shapes climate risks and social vulnerability for local communities, 
the chapter recommends a NYC-focused metric to identify areas of the city that are most vulnerable to the 
intersection of climate hazards, social vulnerability, and displacement. This scoring is utilized for multiple climate 
hazards in NYC and measures the sensitivity of certain populations to the intersection of various risks. Finally, the 
chapter highlights a number of practices and approaches to more equitable and just climate adaptation drawn from 
local, national, and international examples. These examples presuppose, based on the evidence gathered in the 
chapter, that in the absence of anti-displacement strategies in place, the city’s resilience-promoting investments risk 
entrenching existing or creating new inequities by race, ethnicity, and income. As such, the chapter offers best 
practices that prioritize community-driven climate resilience approaches that are integrated, more equitable, and 
racially just. 
1.3 
Chapter Organization 
This Chapter includes five substantive sections. Section 2 provides an overview of progress on climate equity goals 
since NPCC3 (Foster et al., 2019) including NYC’s engagement with and adoption of equity considerations for 
climate-related initiatives across multiple City agencies and functions. The section also includes a review of 
community-led climate equity approaches for the three organizations who co-produced case studies featured in 
NPCC3 (Foster et al., 2019). Section 3 explores climate equity in the context of NYC’s historical context from pre-
colonial times to European colonization to present day and historic racialized land use practices. This section offers a 
framework for understanding the relationships between historic land use practices, climate risk, contemporary land 
use patterns, and social vulnerability. Section 4 reviews the emerging evidence and indicators of climate 
displacement and gentrification. This section also includes an approach for combining climate risks, social 
vulnerability, and displacement risk into a combined index for NYC. Section 5 offers a sample of best practices for 
equitable, racially just, climate adaptation from NYC and beyond. The case studies feature collaborative and 
intersectional approaches to climate adaptation by community-based climate justice organizations from NYC, the 
City’s efforts in Edgemere, Queens, and the non-profit PUSH Buffalo in upstate New York.  
2 Progress Toward Climate Equity in New York City Over the 
Past 5 Years 
2.1 
The City’s Progress Toward Climate Equity Since NPCC3 
In its last report, the NPCC made recommendations for the enhancement of equity in the City’s climate adaptation 
planning, particularly at the neighborhood or community level (Foster et al., 2019). This section of the report will 
review NYC’s engagement with equity in its climate-related work since the NPCC3 report was published in 2019, and 
specifically how the findings of NPCC3 have influenced the city’s work in this area. Our methods include interviews 
with city officials and former city officials who have worked on climate change and equity efforts. We also reviewed 
numerous publicly available documents including executive orders, laws, policy and planning reports, and city-
sponsored websites.  
Prior to 2019, the City’s equity-related climate change efforts largely focused on environmental justice (Foster et al., 
2019). The NPCC3 report offered a framework for how the city might approach climate equity in its adaptation 
planning processes. The NPCC3 Equity Framework consists of three interrelated concepts: distributive equity, 
procedural equity, and contextual or recognitional equity. Contextual equity emphasizes the social, economic, and 
political factors and processes that contribute to uneven vulnerability and shape adaptive capacity (McDermott et al., 
2013). Distributive equity emphasizes disparities across social groups, neighborhoods, and communities in 
vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and outcomes of adaptation actions (McDermott et al., 2013). Procedural equity 
emphasizes the extent and robustness of public and community participation in adaptation planning and decision 
making, such as community engagement during buyout processes (McDermott et al., 2013).

The assessment in this section reflects a review of online content, relevant reports, as well as semi-structured 
interviews with key informants with relevant knowledge of NYC’s past and current equity strategies. Interviews were 
conducted between late 2022 and early 2023 using snowball sampling methods to recruit participants with knowledge 
of City initiatives, including representatives from the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ), 
the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) and the NYC Department of City Planning (Miles & 
Huberman, 1994).1 A total of five interviews were conducted using questions that focused on (1) approaches to 
environmental justice and equity within the context of climate adaptation planning, (2) programs and policies 
developed to address EJ and equity concerns, (3) awareness of the NPCC3 equity framework and whether it was 
incorporated into planning and decision-making process, and (4) challenges associated with implementation. These 
interviews were designed to explore current equity-related initiatives including PovertyNYC, EquityNYC, and the 
Comprehensive Waterfront Plan. The interviews were confidential, and the resulting summaries were member-
checked as each interview participant reviewed them prior to inclusion in the report. Interviewees suggested that the 
NPCC3 equity framework and recommendations were well received by agency staff but applied unevenly across city 
agencies. Some reported not being aware of the framework, others consulted it but found it too technical/academic, 
only useful as background research or thinking, or not useful at all, while some agencies and offices consulted with it 
and used it to inform city plans/policies. 
In general, the City’s climate-related equity work since 2019 has become more explicitly focused on racial disparities. 
The theme of racial equity is especially prominent within NPCC4: Climate Assessment for New York City (Balk, 
Braneon, et al., 2024) and following the changed social and political context since 2019 (e.g., racial disparities in 
exposure and illness that were revealed by the COVID pandemic, racial justice awareness following the police 
murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement). As such, this Report’s 
discussion of climate-related equity efforts can be situated within a broader discussion of the City’s increasing 
engagement with racial and social equity issues in other areas such as housing, policing, and public health.  
Over the past five years, the City has embarked on four parallel and somewhat interrelated sets of actions to foster 
and advance equity:  
(1) legislative and programmatic efforts addressing equity issues related to climate change impacts. These 
included adoption of several new local laws such as LLs 60 & 64 (Local Law 60, 2017; Local Law 64, 
2017), which established the Environmental Justice Advisory Board, EJNYC Report, and EJ Mapping 
Tool (Environmental Justice Interagency Working Group, 2021), and EJNYC Plan (City of New York 
Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023), LL 78 (Local Law 78, 2021), which required 
the creation of a citywide equitable development data tool and racial equity reports for land use 
applications, and LL 122 (Local Law 122, 2021), which mandated a citywide climate adaptation plan;  
(2) internal institutional reforms in the provision of city services (e.g., Executive Order 45 (City of New York 
Office of the Mayor, 2019b) which required the creation and tracking of social equity metrics and 
indicators); 
(3) development of interactive digital and mapping platforms that are publicly accessible designed to track 
and monitor city agencies’ progress (e.g., online Hazard Mitigation Plan (Plan for Hazards - Hazard 
Mitigation - NYCEM, n.d.), and Community Risk Assessment Dashboard (CRA Dashboard – NYC 
Hazard Mitigation, n.d.), EquityNYC (City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 
2023b), Equitable Development Explorer (City of New York Department of City Planning & City of New 
York Housing Preservation and Development, 2023)); 
(4) ongoing efforts to ensure equity in climate risk assessment and sustainability and resilience planning 
(e.g., NPCC4 (New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), n.d.), AdaptNYC (City of New York 
Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022a), Climate, Vulnerability, Impact and 
adaptation (VIA) Analysis (McPhearson et al., 2024), PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done (City of New 
York Office of the Mayor, 2023b).  
 
 
Snowball or chain sampling involves utilizing well informed people to identify critical cases or informants who have a great deal of 
information about a phenomenon (Miles & Huberman, 1994)

2.1.1 
Legislative and programmatic efforts addressing equity issues related to climate change 
impacts 
As discussed in the introductory section, prior to the last NPCC3 report, the City was already committed to advancing 
equity with respect to addressing climate change impacts and developing place-based adaptation strategies, 
especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy (2012). These efforts included initiatives such as OneNYC: The Plan 
for a Strong and Just City (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2019a) the Resilient Neighborhoods studies 
(Resilient Neighborhoods, n.d.), and the Cool Neighborhoods (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2017) 
program. At the same time, environmental justice and social advocacy organizations had expressed that the City 
needed to do more for under-resourced groups and communities of color. This included more directly addressing the 
needs of vulnerable populations, improving community-based evacuation and disaster response, and supporting 
community-based resilience planning, specifically for neighborhoods adjacent to the Significant Maritime and 
Industrial Areas (SMIAs) (Bautista et al., 2016). Additionally, several EJ organizations and the New York City Council 
felt that the City’s vision for coastal resilience, as previously laid out in the NYC Special Initiative for Rebuilding and 
Recovery (SIRR) plan, was too Manhattan-centric and did not account for unique challenges in each of the five 
boroughs and diverse communities across NYC, nor did it prepare them for the next superstorms (Iqbal, 2019; S. 
Maldonado, 2021; Sandy Regional Assembly, 2013). 
In response, the City has increased efforts to understand community risk profiles, especially with a focus on 
historically disadvantaged and environmental justice communities. In particular, the City Council and local 
representatives from EJ organizations have emerged as key players in advancing and institutionalizing environmental 
justice and equity in the City’s long-term climate adaptation planning efforts. Key legislations and activities adopted by 
the City Council that have resulted in the actions undertaken by the Mayor’s Office, specifically MOCEJ, and other 
city agencies include:  
■ 
Local Law 60 required a comprehensive EJ report and Local Law 64 an EJ advisory board and an EJ 
interagency working group (Local Law 60, 2017; Local Law 64, 2017). These laws subsequently resulted in the 
establishment of the Environmental Justice Advisory Board (EJAB) and the convening of the Environmental 
Justice Interagency Working Group (EJ IWG) (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental 
Justice, 2023). Led by MOCEJ, EJ IWG is responsible for the development of the EJNYC report, the EJ Web-
based Portal and Mapping Tool, and the EJNYC Plan. In December 2021, MOECJ and the EJ IWG released 
the Environmental Justice for All Scope of Work Report, which provided a roadmap for the development of the 
EJNYC report, mapping tool, and comprehensive plan (Environmental Justice Interagency Working Group (EJ 
IWG), 2021). These products are designed to systematically analyze EJ concerns citywide, to identify 
communities that are disproportionately impacted by environmental burdens and may not experience the 
benefits from green and climate resilient investments, and to inform city-level decision-making processes and 
programmatic initiatives that can advance climate and environmental justice.  
■ 
In 2020, the City Council released its own climate action agenda, Securing Our Future: Strategies for NYC in 
the Fight against Climate Change (New York City Council, 2020). This report included strategies for climate 
resiliency planning, GHG emission reduction, clean energy transition, waste reduction and circular economy, 
and workforce development for green jobs.  
■ 
Local Law 78 required a citywide equitable development data tool and racial equity reports for certain land use 
actions (Local Law 78, 2021). This legislation has resulted in the creation of the Equitable Development Data 
Explorer (EDDE) tool (City of New York Department of City Planning & City of New York Housing Preservation 
and Development, 2023) and a displacement risk map by the NYC Department of City Planning (DCP) and 
Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) (City of New York Department of City Planning 
& City of New York Housing Preservation and Development, 2023). The EDDE is an interactive resource that 
provides analysis about the social, economic, and housing conditions in communities across NYC. The 
displacement risk map measures levels of displacement risk for neighborhoods citywide based on factors such 
as population vulnerability, housing conditions, and market pressure. This legislation also required Racial 
Equity Reports for certain land use actions, and applicants must include a study that analyzes the area’s 
demographic conditions, quality of life, and displacement risk (ANHD, 2023). These initiatives sought to 
address growing concerns about gentrification and displacement linked to land use changes, rezonings, and 
real estate development trends that are happening in NYC.  
■ 
Local Law 122 mandated the creation of a citywide climate adaptation plan to protect every neighborhood from 
a wide range of hazards and prioritize the most vulnerable areas and EJ areas (Local Law 122, 2021). This 
legislation has resulted in the establishment of the AdaptNYC (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & 
Environmental Justice, 2022a) and Climate Strong Communities (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & 
Environmental Justice, 2022b) programs, both of which are overseen by MOCEJ. AdaptNYC is an online 
program that identifies climate change hazards that pose the greatest threats, populations and neighborhoods

8 
that are most at risk, and the adaptation and resiliency measures that the City is currently taking to protect 
residents, property, and infrastructure. Climate Strong Communities is a neighborhood-based resiliency and 
sustainability planning program in which MOCEJ identifies vulnerable communities and engages local 
stakeholders to implement infrastructure and other measures that address adaptation needs. MOCEJ has 
already started working with communities in Brownsville and Canarsie, Brooklyn; Corona, Queens; East 
Harlem, Manhattan; Port Richmond, Staten Island; and Soundview, the Bronx (City of New York Office of the 
Mayor, 2023b). 
2.1.2 
Fostering internal institutional reforms to advance racial equity and social justice 
In the past few years, the City has increased efforts to advance racial equity and social justice within city agencies. In 
2018, NYC joined the Government Alliance for Racial Equity (GARE), a network of municipal governments that 
provides strategies for combating racism and promoting racial equity within city governments (Government Alliance 
on Race and Equity, 2023). Staff from then Mayor de Blasio’s Office of Climate Resiliency (predecessor to MOCEJ) 
employed GARE’s Racial Equity Assessment Tools, a step-by-step analysis of equity goals, stakeholder and 
community engagement, and outcomes (Office of Climate Resiliency, personal communication, December 2, 2022). 
The tool also provided staff members with relevant language to discuss environmental and climate justice issues. City 
staff consulted with and received feedback from other municipal government representatives to better understand 
how racial equity can be operationalized within the city. Highly motivated staff members formed an internal Equity 
Work Team, which functioned as a centralized think-tank for developing racial equity policy, fostering internal 
changes, building institutional capacity and mechanisms for hiring people, soliciting buy-in and feedback from 
leadership, promoting horizontal collaboration, and breaking down bureaucratic silos. These efforts culminated, in 
part, in the creation of an anti-racism city charter, hiring protocols that address racial justice, and the incorporation of 
environmental justice and racial justice into the fabric of the city’s work (Office of Climate Resiliency, personal 
communication, December 2, 2022). 
In 2019, Mayor de Blasio signed Executive Order 45 (EO45) (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2019b, p. 45), 
which mandated the annual creation of the Social and Equity Indicators Report by the Mayor’s Office for Economic 
Opportunity (now referred to as NYC Opportunity) (City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2023b; 
Executive Order 45, 2019). The report, which exists as an interactive digital platform EquityNYC, is intended to 
measure the social, economic, and environmental health of the city. It analyzes equity outcomes in eight policy 
domains including: (1) core infrastructure and environment, (2) diverse and inclusive government, (3) economic 
security and mobility, (4) education, (5) empowered residents and neighborhoods, (6) health and well-being, (7) 
housing, and (8) personal and community safety. It also includes standardized equity metrics that measure city 
agencies’ work through equity lens such as (1) city services, (2) service locations, (3) workforce diversity, (4) M/WBE 
contract distribution, and (5) internal equity practices. Data for equity outcomes and standardized equity metrics must 
be collected, analyzed and disaggregated by race/ethnicity, gender identity, income, and, where available, sexual 
orientation. The dataset for EquityNYC is publicly available through NYC Open Data (City of New York Mayor’s Office 
for Economic Opportunity, 2023b).  
Additionally, as part of EO45, staff members from Mayor’s Office of Climate Resiliency participated in a 9-month 
training program hosted by the Mayor’s Office of Operations to learn how to institutionalize Results-Based 
Accountability (RBA) and incorporate racial and social equity principles into long-term strategic planning processes 
within the agency and with communities (Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ), personal 
communication, July 27, 2023). This effort helped conceptualize the early development of the Climate Strong 
Communities initiative (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022b).  
In the past year, NYC Opportunity has developed a series of mapping platforms that help the public visualize 
distribution of equity outcomes, city services, and city service locations (City of New York Mayor’s Office for 
Economic Opportunity, 2023b). The office continues to partner with city agencies to routinely collect data on service 
programs, examine equity strategies, and develop new programs and policies that aim to reduce service disparities 
(Office for Economic Opportunity, personal communication, January 5, 2023, p. 4). Since 2020, over 40 city agencies 
(City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2023b) have completed an annual online survey (City of 
New York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2023b) that inventories internal equity practices such as 
formation of working groups to reduce social and racial inequality, specialized training on equity-related concepts and 
skills, strategies to promote equitable hiring processes, training and mentorship programs to support career 
advancement for individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups, and contracting with equity consultants or 
third party vendors to support social and racial equity work (City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic 
Opportunity, 2023a). These EquityNYC-related initiatives represent a concerted effort to provide transparency and 
accountability about the City's equity work, which is key for addressing service disparities and tailoring policy 
responses (Office for Economic Opportunity, personal communication, January 5, 2023, p. 4).

Other city-level agencies and entities have also developed initiatives to promote internal reforms and racial equity. In 
2020, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) released the Race to Justice Action Kit (City of New 
York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023), an initiative that evolved from earlier efforts started in 
2016(Human Impact Partners, 2019) to address racism in healthcare. The Race to Justice Action Kit provides an 
overview of the effects of racism on historical and contemporary health, communication tips for staff, a language use 
guide, and a community engagement framework. Additionally, with strong support from DOHMH, in 2021, the NYC 
Board of Health adopted a resolution to declare racism a public health crisis (City of New York Department of Health 
and Mental Hygiene, 2021a). Furthermore, in 2020, the NYC Commission on Human Rights released a report on 
“Black New Yorkers on Their Experiences of Antiblack Racism,” which included recommended strategies for internal 
and structural reforms and for advancing racial equity among city agencies and offices (City of New York Commission 
on Human Rights, 2019). In spring 2022, Mayor Eric Adams created the Mayor’s Office of Equity, which oversees 
multiple equity-related offices and commissions including the Commission on Gender Equity, the Racial Justice 
Commission, the Pay Equity Cabinet, the Unity Project, the Young Men’s initiative, and the Taskforce on Racial 
Inclusion and Equity (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Equity, 2023).  
In the latest NYC Comprehensive Waterfront Plan (CWP) (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b), 
language relating to equity, racial justice, environmental justice, and climate justice was consistently deployed (City of 
New York Department of City Planning, 2021b; Office of Climate Resiliency, personal communication, January 12, 
2023). In the previous version developed under Bloomberg (i.e., Vision 2020 (City of New York Department of City 
Planning, 2011), these terms did not make a single appearance. In the current CWP (City of New York Department of 
City Planning, 2021b), equity is conveyed as one of the three guiding values and climate justice as the driving 
principle (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b). The CWP explicitly recognizes the historical legacy 
of structural racism, marginalization, discrimination, and economic inequality, as well as the disproportionate impacts 
of climate change on low-income communities and communities of color. It also features examples of initiatives 
related to just transition (e.g., Edgemere Community Land Trust, Sunset Park Solar) and includes language 
expressing commitments to racial equity (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b). The usage of these 
terms, particularly references to racial inequity and injustice, represents a shift in the City’s approach to addressing 
equity and climate change. In another example, the NPCC3’s climate equity framework was applied to inform the 
development of MOCEJ’s Neighborhood Coastal Protection Planning Guidance, which provides best practices for 
siting of city-level capital coastal protection projects (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate Resiliency, 2021). 
2.1.3 
Development of indicators and metrics to track progress on equity and digital and 
interactive mapping platforms to foster transparency and accountability 
Over the past decade, the City, specifically through NYC Opportunity, has increased efforts to track and monitor 
progress on reducing poverty rates as well as spatial and socio-demographic disparities in city-funded provisions. 
NYC Opportunity leads multiple initiatives to develop indicators and metrics for social and racial equity (described in 
the section above) (Social Indicators Report - NYC Opportunity, n.d.) and performance measures for poverty 
reduction (Poverty Measure - NYC Opportunity, n.d.) and equitable workforce development (Workforce Data Portal, 
n.d.) See Table 1: Indicators and Metrics for City-Funded Provisions. Performance measures are designed to assess 
outcomes of specific policy interventions, for example, to determine the effects of anti-poverty initiatives (e.g., tax 
credit programs, food stamps, nutritional assistance programs) on poverty rates or who benefits from city-sponsored 
career development and employment services. To provide users with a more complete picture of city-provided 
activities, NYC Opportunity routinely collects data from city agencies and partner organizations, which can date back 
to the year 2000 and up to the present, and disaggregates them by race/ethnicity, gender, and income. Data on 
social and racial equity and workforce development, along with data stories and related programs, are accessible 
through online platforms and digital navigators such as EquityNYC (City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic 
Opportunity, 2023b), Workforce Data Portal (Workforce Data Portal, n.d.), Jobs NYC (Jobs NYC, n.d.), and 
AccessNYC (ACCESS NYC, n.d.).

The development of publicly accessible online platforms is part of a larger effort across city agencies to communicate 
progress and activities on the external facing side (Office for Economic Opportunity, personal communication, 
January 5, 2023, p. 4). These new tools are intended to build a culture of transparency and accountability and 
employed to justify the City’s decisions to address social, economic and health disparities in underserved areas 
(Office for Economic Opportunity, personal communication, December 8, 2022, p. 2). In recent years, city agencies 
have created multiple tools to visualize data on population, land use and zoning, and environmental risks and 
vulnerability, and data sources for many of these tools are available for download on NYC Open Data (City of New 
York, 2022, see Table 2). 
Specifically, there has been an increase in spatial visualization platforms designed to promote and/or enhance 
planning at the community or neighborhood level. City agencies and community-based organizations can find 
community-level data on demographic information, land use, and flood and heat vulnerability. They can also compare 
distributions of city services, facilities, zoning applications, broadband access, and mitigation and resilience projects 
among the City’s 59 community districts. 
To integrate environmental justice concerns into citywide spatial planning, MOCEJ, in collaboration with EJAB and EJ 
IWG, is set to release a public, web-based portal and mapping tool detailing environmental and climate data; this 
action is a direct result of the passage of Local Law 60 and 64 in 2017 (Local Law 60, 2017; Local Law 64, 2017). To 
address growing community concerns regarding housing development and displacement risks, the NYC DCP and 
HPD created the Equitable Development Data Explorer (EDDE) (City of New York Department of City Planning & City 
of New York Housing Preservation and Development, 2023) as a response to Local Law 78 in 2021 (Local Law 78, 
2021). The EDDE provides analysis of the demographic, social, economic, and housing conditions along with 
displacement risks for NYC communities and can be used for community advocacy purposes and/or inform planning 
decisions on affordable housing, capital investments, and land use. To complement the EDDE, DCP also developed 
two interactive platforms that examined the dynamics of racial/Hispanic composition (City of New York Department of 
City Planning, 2021a) and stability and change in NYC neighborhoods (City of New York Department of City 
Planning, 2023b). The creation of an EJ mapping tool, the EDDE, and other neighborhood-based visualization tools is 
consistent with growing nationwide recognition of the need to address historic inequities in the most at-risk 
communities. NYC-level data can be cross-referenced with other relevant spatial data visualization tools such as the 
US Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Justice Screening Tool (US EPA, 2014) and the national 
Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (Executive Office of the President of the United States Council on 
Environmental Quality, 2023). 
In addition, an increasing number of policy and planning documents are available online in digital and interactive 
formats that can be changed and updated over time, with some functioning as “living” documents rather than static 
ones. Examples include the NYC Hazard Mitigation Plan (City of New York Office of Emergency Management, 2019), 
the 2021 Comprehensive Waterfront Plan (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b), EquityNYC (City of 
New York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2023b), AdaptNYC (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & 
Environmental Justice, 2022a), and OneNYC 2050 (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023a).

2.1.4 
Ongoing efforts to incorporate equity in climate risk assessments and in sustainability and 
resilience planning  
The City continues to incorporate equity in ongoing efforts to conduct climate risk assessments (e.g., Climate 
Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis project) and in sustainability and resilience planning (e.g., PlaNYC: 
Getting Sustainability Done). At present, MOCEJ is currently sponsoring the Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and 
Adaptation Analysis (VIA) study (McPhearson et al., 2024), an 18-month interdisciplinary initiative to develop a 
comprehensive analysis of future potential climatic conditions and associated socio-economic impacts in NYC. VIA-
related projects include (1) high-resolution climate projections for heat risk and exposure, storm surge, and coastal 
flooding, (2) characterizing current and future extreme heavy rainfall, (3) systematic assessment of health-related 
economic costs from climate sensitive events, and (4) a creation of a Flood Vulnerability Index to identify areas with 
the highest vulnerability to coastal storm surge, tidal, and pluvial flooding. The VIA research has the potential to 
advance equity by providing key information and tracking tools on populations facing the brunt of climate impacts now 
and in the future. Together with the EJNYC report, the VIA research will also inform other efforts to develop forward-
looking adaptation strategies and plans that prioritize vulnerable populations and EJ areas.  
In April 2023, the City, led by the Adams administration, unveiled its latest vision for sustainability and resiliency 
called PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). This plan functions as an 
update and successor to de Blasio’s OneNYC: A Strong and Just City (City of New York, 2015). Building on the 
previous administration’s focus on equity, the new sustainability plan centers environmental justice and health equity 
as core components for near-term and long-range climate action planning. It proposes multiple climate resiliency 
initiatives that prioritize vulnerable populations (e.g., NYCHA residents, low-income and moderate-income 
households, basement apartment dwellers) and environmental justice communities. Example initiatives include 
piloting Resilience Hubs in areas that are exposed to flood- and storm-related hazards and across NYCHA campuses 
and Cool Corridors in areas that are disproportionally affected by the urban heat island effect with a focus on 
environmental justice communities (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). Others include the Climate Strong 
Communities program designed to identify climate resilience investments in communities that were left out by 
Hurricane Sandy recovery funding and the FloodHelpNY and the HomeFix programs to help low- and moderate-
income homeowners with acquiring flood insurance coverage, repairs, and resilience retrofits (Center for NYC 
Neighborhoods, n.d.; City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2024; City of New 
York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022b). The plan also addresses equity in terms of access 
to sustainability and green economy investments by prioritizing historically underserved communities. Example 
initiatives include creation of multi-purpose green infrastructure (e.g., nature-based stormwater management 
solutions, greenways, greenspace), bike lanes, urban farms and community gardens, community brownfield planning 
grants, electrification and efficiency upgrades for NYCHA housing, and workforce development and training for green 
and circular economy sectors.  
In combination with municipal capital spending, the City is counting on new federal and state funding streams to 
develop and implement its sustainability and resiliency initiatives (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). The 
latest PlaNYC outlines ambitious strategies for leveraging these sources of funding, which include the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the New York State (NYS) 
Environmental Bond Act as well as from other sources such as the Federal Healthy Street Programs, Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)’s Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and 
Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Assistance program, and other grants from federal and state agencies (City of New 
York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). The City is pursuing federal and state funding to implement efforts including the 
Climate Strong Communities program, Resilience Hubs, Cool Corridors, stormwater management projects, clean 
energy projects, municipal fleet electrification, green workforce training, and other climate and environmental projects. 
It has recently called on the federal government to provide $8.5 billion in pre-disaster mitigation funding to implement 
unfunded resiliency projects (Mayor Adams Commemorates 10th Anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, 2022). In terms 
of advancing equity, grants and programs funded by the IIJA and IRA are subjected to the Justice40 initiative, an 
provision inspired by and similar to the environmental justice provision in the NYS’ Climate Leadership and 
Community Protection Act (CLCPA) (New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, 2019), 
requiring that “40 percent of overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that 
are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution” (The White House, 2022, p. 40). Tracking how the 
CLCPA’s EJ provision (New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, 2019) and the Justice40 
initiative (The White House, 2022, p. 40) are implemented and how climate investments are distributed at local and 
neighborhood levels requires further research. 
While the City has developed numerous plans, policies, and programs to advance equity in climate adaptation 
planning, efforts to track and monitor equity issues with respect to climate resilience investments are in early stages. 
Existing efforts include the Sandy Funding Tracker (City of New York Office of Emergency Management, 2023b) and 
the NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM)’s Mitigation Actions Map (Actions Map – NYC Hazard Mitigation, n.d.), 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

13 
but these tools do not provide a complete picture of the City’s spending on climate resilience or on the status of 
completed and planned projects. For example, while the Sandy Funding Tracker provides information about how 
much federal grant money has been spent, it does not include the status or anticipated completion dates for federally 
funded projects nor include information about the City’s capital contributions to these projects (Yeung & Levers, 
2022). On the other hand, while NYCEM’s Mitigation Actions Map conveys the status and location of the City’s capital 
investments in hazard mitigation projects, without a clear picture of community-specific strategies for climate risks 
and vulnerability, it remains difficult to determine whether local adaptation needs are being met. It may be noted 
though that, at the least, the NYCEM’s Climate Risk Assessment Dashboard (City of New York Office of Emergency 
Management, 2023a) includes a Risk Report feature for each neighborhood, assisting in understanding local 
adaptation needs and providing information on community programmatic resources. Efforts to develop community-
level climate risk assessment and resilience strategies such as the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)’s NY & NJ 
Harbor & Tributaries Coastal Storm Risk Management Study (NYNJHATS), the VIA project, and the Climate Strong 
Communities are only now underway. In the Ten Years after Sandy: Barriers to Resilience report (Yeung & Levers, 
2022), the New York City Office of the Comptroller found that as of June 2022, the City has only spent 73 percent of 
the $15 billion of federally appropriated grants for Sandy recovery and resilience (Yeung & Levers, 2022). Slow 
progress can be attributed to complexity of projects, lengthy coordination and approval requirements by federal 
agencies, and challenges associated with community engagement (S. Maldonado, 2022).The Comptroller office 
recommended that the City accelerates the pace of resiliency spending and improve public transparency of capital 
project tracking, particularly by establishing the Capital Project Tracker that provides accessible neighborhood-level 
information about resiliency projects with details such as budgets, timelines, and management entities (Yeung & 
Levers, 2022). The City established the NYC Capital Projects Dashboard in 2023 in response to the Comptroller’s 
recommendation (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Operations, 2024). 
In the last few years, MOCEJ has increased efforts to communicate the City’s progress on climate action in clearer 
and more accessible manners. Its website has been updated and streamlined to convey information about climate 
hazards and ongoing work on climate change adaptation, sustainability, and environmental justice. The agency 
recently created a webpage (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022c) that 
compiles key coastal infrastructure studies and projects that are taking place across five boroughs. While Manhattan 
is home to many large-scale projects funded by federal post-Sandy recovery and rebuilding grants (e.g., the East 
Side Coastal Resiliency project, the Battery Coastal Resilience Project, the Battery Park City Resilience projects, the 
Brooklyn –Bridge-Montgomery Coastal Resiliency project), others such as the Interim Flood Protection Measures 
Program (IFPM), Living Breakwaters, Raised Shorelines, Red Hook Coastal Resiliency, and other USACE-led 
resiliency projects are being implemented in other boroughs.  
Another mechanism that can potentially enable transparent tracking of sustainability and resiliency funding and 
spending is the climate budgeting initiative (Khan & Adams, 2023). Together with the City of London, New York is 
among the first to adopt a systematic approach “that incorporates science-based climate considerations into the 
budget decision-making process by evaluating how actions and spending today contribute to meeting longer-term 
climate targets” (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b; Khan & Adams, 2023). The initiative is led by the 
Mayor’s Office of Budget and Management (OMB)’s Environmental Sustainability and Resiliency Taskforce in 
partnership with MOCEJ, who are working to include resilience, sustainability, and equity indicators when reviewing 
budget proposals from city agencies. Information about the process will be documented in an annual publication, to 
be released in April 2024, which highlights the City’s investments and provides a snapshot of progress on meeting 
long-term climate goals (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b).  
2.1.5 
Remaining equity concerns 
Since the publication of the NPCC3 report in 2019, the City’s framing of equity has broadened from initially focusing 
on environmental justice to later including racial justice and climate justice. There has also been a shift in usage of 
language and concepts about equity in planning discussions.  City-level efforts aimed to address the institutional 
foundation for advancing social and racial equity, starting with an explicit recognition of the legacy and persistent 
effects of structural racism on health, income, and access to services as a first step to operationalizing racial equity 
and social justice. The development of digital visualization tools and mapping platforms, as well as making city-level 
data more accessible and available, enables city agencies to better communicate progress and foster a culture of 
transparency and accountability (and thus trust) with the public. Recently adoption of laws such as LLs 60 & 64 in 
2017 and LL 78 &122 in 2021 (Local Law 60, 2017; Local Law 64, 2017; Local Law 78, 2021; Local Law 122, 2021) 
ensures that consideration for environmental justice and equity in climate adaptation planning efforts will be key

14 
priorities for subsequent mayoral administrations and that these priorities will continue beyond the usual political 
cycles. 
At the same time, several key equity concerns remain:  
■ 
The City has numerous initiatives to assess and characterize climate risks including the SIRR initiative (City of 
New York Office of the Mayor, 2013), Heat Vulnerability Index (City of New York Department of Health and 
Mental Hygiene, 2022a), Flood Hazard Mapper (City of New York, 2023a), Comprehensive Waterfront Plan 
(City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b), and Community Risk Assessment Dashboard (CRA 
Dashboard – NYC Hazard Mitigation, n.d.) but there is a need to develop more adaptation strategies and plans 
that reflect the unique context and address challenges of each of the five boroughs, 59 community districts, 
and/or specific neighborhoods. To date, the Resilient Neighborhood studies (Resilient Neighborhoods, n.d.), 
Cool Neighborhoods NYC (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2017), Lower Manhattan Coastal 
Resilience Projects (Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency (LMCR), n.d.), and the Resilient Edgemere 
Community Plan (City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2017) are among 
the few city-sponsored community-based adaptation plans. While Climate Strong Communities initiative is 
designed to address local equity and adaptation concerns, it is in the early stages of implementation. A better 
understanding of how specific climate risks (e.g., flooding, heat) affect individual communities and 
neighborhoods will allow the City to tailor policy responses and resource allocation, develop mechanisms for 
soliciting inputs and buy-in, and document benefits and outcomes.  
■ 
As the City works with state and federal agencies to develop climate adaptation and resilience projects, there 
is a need to systematically document and track climate investments to ensure communities are prioritized 
equitably and their adaptation needs are met. The Sandy Funding Tracker,(City of New York Office of 
Emergency Management, 2023b) NYCEM’s Mitigation Actions Maps,(Actions Map – NYC Hazard Mitigation, 
n.d.) and the Comptroller’s Climate Dashboard are web-based platforms that allow users to see what and 
where climate investments are sited. City agencies need to assess equity impacts of climate investments, 
particularly the effects of these investments on existing social, economic, and housing conditions in 
neighborhoods and ensure that new projects reflect local stakeholders’ goals, visions, and desires. City-
sponsored adaptation projects should be developed in synergy with existing community-led planning efforts, 
particularly those by local EJ and community advocacy organizations, to ensure concrete community benefits 
and equitable outcomes. The work by OMB and MOECJ on climate budgeting can ensure transparency and 
equity when tracking climate investment spending. In response to the Comptroller’s recommendation, the City 
developed the NYC Capital Project Dashboard (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Operations, 2024) to 
monitor how resiliency is being integrated into capital projects (Yeung & Levers, 2022). Further research is 
needed to understand how city agencies and land use applicants comply with Local Law 78 (Local Law 78, 
2021), which requires racial equity reports for certain land use actions, and whether this regulation results in 
meaningful outcomes for communities facing displacement risks. 
■ 
Through the EquityNYC initiative, the City has developed robust equity metrics and indicators that capture 
multiple dimensions of governance, but this effort is largely focused on disparities in city-funded services (i.e., 
distributive equity) (City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2023b). Development of 
indicators and metrics that can capture other dimensions of equity such as procedural or contextual equity is a 
more difficult task. It will require further research and consultation with local stakeholders to ensure that city-
level datasets reflect on-the-ground reality and service disparities have improved. Similarly, future efforts to 
track equity progress and visualize spatial data should include a public and/or community engagement 
component. On the other hand, limited efforts exist in developing equity indicators and metrics regarding 
climate adaptation and resilience planning. The City, specifically city agencies such as MOCEJ, DCP, NYCEM, 
and NYC Opportunity along with NPCC, can expand upon the EquityNYC initiative and NPCC3’s New York 
City Climate Change Indicators and Monitoring Systems (NYCLIM) framework (Blake et al., 2019; City of New 
York Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2023b) and develop community-specific indicators and indices 
that can capture dimensions such as social and health vulnerability, disparate exposure, adaptive capacity, 
mobility, and housing. Available resources for consultation include the City of San Diego’s Climate Equity 
Index and the City of Cincinnati’s Climate Equity Indicators for Neighborhoods (City of San Diego Sustainability 
Department, 2019; Even et al., 2021).

2.2 
Community-level Action and Progress Toward Climate Equity 
The NPCC3 Chapter: Community-Based Assessments of Adaptation and Equity (2019) featured three case studies 
co-produced with environmental justice organizations, including WEACT for Environmental Justice in northern 
Manhattan; UPROSE in Sunset Park, Brooklyn; and The Point CDC in Hunts Point, in the Bronx. These case studies 
included a review of environmental, climate, and social stressors as well as climate action plans developed by these 
groups. In NPCC3 (2019) Chapter on Equity, section 6.5.1 Community-based adaptation initiatives and projects, a 
review of each organization’s climate adaptation projects and their approach to community engagement were 
summarized. Since the release of NPCC3, these communities have continued to both implement and evolve their 
approaches to climate, environmental and social stressors. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities 
represented by these organizations and increasing climate change-related extreme weather events like Hurricane Ida 
have also required dynamic approaches to meet the needs of their respective communities.  
Table 3 summarizes updates to some of the climate-related projects that were featured in NPCC3. 
The updates reflect a review of each organization’s website and other online sources, as well as information from 
semi-structured interviews conducted with Sonal Jessel (Director of Policy) from We Act and Elizabeth Yeampierre 
(Executive Director), and John Fleming (Development Director/Project Manager) of UpRose. We were unable to 
reach The Point CDC for interviews, thus updates reflect the information found online.

Historical Dispossession of Land and Land Uses 
The climate change challenges we currently face in NYC are inextricably linked to the bioregion’s (see BOX 1) history 
of settler colonialism, extractivism, imperial trade, and slavery (The Public History Project, 2023). An understanding of 
this historical context is essential for formulating effective policies that address the rapidly changing climate. In 
addition, local Indigenous knowledge provides valuable ecosystemic insights that can help us all move toward 
Cases

Climate Justice Youth Summit was last held in 2019 and then paused due to Covid. UPROSE 
continues to organize youth and intergenerational groups of residents in  “Learning Circles” that 
entail climate adaptation discussions.  
■ 
Block Captains, a program that trains volunteers to contribute to resilience work in the Sunset Park 
neighborhood, was put on hold and shifted to a  campaign focused on land use proposals for

Sunset Park Solar is a 685-kilowatt solar project to be built on the Brooklyn Army Terminal rooftop. 
The cooperative will include 200 community solar subscribers who receive 15% savings on their 
monthly energy bills.  Project construction was delayed due to the pandemic but leasing and 
financing agreements are being finalized and construction is expected to begin this year. 
WE ACT 
■ 
Northern Manhattan Climate Action Plan (NMCA) is a community-informed agenda for addressing 
climate change in northern Manhattan, with strong energy democracy principles.  The plan targets 
publicly owned power, renewable energy generation, sustainable housing, and a resilient built 
environment.  
■ 
Solar Uptown Now (SUN) project is now complete, with 415 KW of installed solar on Housing 
Development Fund Corporation (HDFC) co-operatives in northern Manhattan.  
■ 
Community Solar project installed solar on three NYCHA buildings and trained over 100 NYCHA 
residents in solar installation.  
■ 
The NYCHA Villages report (de Hoz & Abreu, 2019) was issued by WeAct on Healthy and 
Sustainable Public Housing. The report addresses issues of mold, maintenance defects, pests, and 
power outages. This led NYDEC to fund the Inwood Climate Change & Health Project which 
expanded beyond Dyckman Houses to look at climate change and health initiatives throughout the  
Inwood neighborhood. 
The Point CDC 
The Point CDC was a project partner for Hunts Point Lifelines, a proposal funded by US HUD’s Rebuild 
by Design program after Hurricane Sandy. Although the City convened a working group to solicit 
community input, residents raised concerns about limited input and the risk of displacement of proposed 
resiliency efforts (Foster et al., 2019). A 2020 Hunts Point Resiliency Feasibility study of the proposal 
recommended the energy components be considered for implementation, while issues like coastal 
flooding be deferred for future implementation ((NYCEDC, 2020). FEMA announced NYC EDC was a 
recipient of BRIC funding to dry floodproof two food facilities at Hunts Point that are most at risk of storm 
surge flooding (FEMA, 2022). The Point CDC was a member of the Hunts Point Forward Working Group, 
which supported development of the engagement process, recommendations, and implementation 
pathways for the Hunts Point Forward plan (NYCEDC, 2023) part of the City’s $140 million investment in 
Hunts Point infrastructure. The Hunts Point Forward plan builds from EDC’s first neighborhood-wide plan 
for the area, the 2004 Hunts Point Vision Plan .

repairing the broken human-environment relationship. Urban agriculture, land stewardship, and community gardens 
are three promising examples illustrating urban processes of relinking to nature. 
BOX 1. The Great Tidal Ecoregion 
The Algonquian term for what British colonialists boasted as the “Hudson River” is Mahicannitukw or “great tidal river.” This 
“ecoregion”, roughly the NYC metropolitan region, has been a thriving place where land, sea, and rivers converge. Compressed 
herein is an elaborate estuary in a relatively small area fostering thriving life energies. 
At the southernmost boundary of the Wisconsin ice sheet of 20,000 years ago, this “end moraine” left a ridge elevation of mineral 
soil, gravel, sand, silt, and clay amidst a saltwater / freshwater habitat for shellfish, waterfowl, migrating fish, and Lunaape (Lenape) 
with allied Algonquian communities. 
Upland forests, rich in nut bearing trees, provided additional food and shelter; and selective burning sustained forests and 
grasslands that extended the palette of plants and creatures used for dietary, cultural, and medicinal uses. This tending of native 
flora and fauna created a dynamic seasonal natural economy.

Dutch and British colonizers intent on maximizing their profits in local and global markets, took limited regard for the local 
ecosystems. By 1750, Dutch naturalist Pehr Kalm remarked how the forests of New Jersey were “already more ruined than any 
others.” (Kalm, 1770, p. 50) 
Well before industrial pollution, this attitude of endless “natural resource” extraction disrupted the regenerative and sustainable local 
cycle of tending, what Indigenous ethnobotanist Robin Wall Kimmerer frames as the tradition of the “honorable harvest” of “take 
only what you need and use everything you take.” (Kimmerer, 2013, pp. 148, 179)

With recent IPCC acknowledgment of both Indigenous Local Knowledge (ILK) and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) it is 
increasingly possible to have a mutually respectful dialogue on how a dynamic ecology might be better balanced within the NY 
metro ecoregion within the larger bioregion.2 Notably, NYC Greenmarkets interlinking local small farmers with NYC Parks, cobbled 
together by Robert Lewis over three decades is one such effort.(The WNET Group, 2007)

Roughly twenty thousand years ago, during the last peak of glaciation, NYC was sealed in a layer of ice thousands of 
feet thick (Stanford, 2010). As the ice melted in the following centuries, rivers were rerouted, channels were carved, 
and a brand-new landscape emerged.  
For all beings of the Northeast coast, survival required adaptation to these post-glacial and climate fluctuations. Coast 
Algonquian communities cultivated a deep intimacy with their environments, moving around the area as the seasons 
shifted their protein sources (Bragdon, 2005).  
The Munsee speaking Lunaape people referred to the river we now call the Hudson as "Mahicannitukw," meaning 
"the great tidal river" (The Public History Project, 2020). The makeup of the Mahicannitukw river—its waters fresh at 
the northern end but increasingly briny as it approaches the Atlantic—created the ideal habitat for salmon, shad, 
sturgeon, whales, and particularly the critical keystone species of oysters, along with a long list of dependent species 
in this food web. Additionally, post-glacial pond formations became home to beavers, turtles, waterfowl, plants with 
medicinal properties, and other flora and fauna valued by Indigenous people. These environments made the region a 
hub for human food, travel, and trade long before the first European settlers arrived (Lynch et al., 2012; Sanderson, 
2009).  
The Indigenous communities of our region shared in common a developed, nuanced language, and an understanding 
of the relationship between humans and the ecologies that nourished them (Goddard, 2010). They thrived in the 
region by “tending the wilderness”–employing sustainable harvesting and permaculture farming methods and by 
maintaining a delicate balance with their surroundings.

2 “Bioregion” and “ecoregion” are formulations of nature/human relational places by systems ecologists that engage in a dialogue 
with ILK, TEK, and Western-trained scientists and systems theory. “A bioregion is a self-reliant geographic unit defined through 
watersheds, ecoregions, hard physical boundaries and the cultures that stem within them. Bioregion is short for ‘bio-cultural region’ 
and are geographically based areas defined by physical traits; land or soil composition, watershed, climate, flora, and fauna; as well 
as the cultural traits of the inhabitants that live within them, and act upon them. Ultimately, they are defined by the people living 
within them.”(Cascadia Department of Bioregion, 2024)  (See also Thomashow (Thomashow, 2001))

Their practices included selective harvesting, which meant only taking what was necessary while allowing plants and 
wildlife to replenish themselves, along with controlled burning of the grasslands, which served many purposes. For 
instance, burning enriched the soil, which allowed strawberries to crop up in profusion, beckoning the animals they 
hunted, such as passenger pigeons and turkeys. These practices reflected their intimacy with the land as a living 
system and the understanding that their own well-being depended on ecosystem health and on practicing care for “all 
our relations,” animal and plant alike (LaDuke, 2016). 
3.1.2 
European colonization and ransacking the commons 
The “discovery” of the Mahicannitukw river by Henry Hudson in 1609 set off an era of drastic change in the uses and 
abuse of our bioregion (Jennings, 1975; Kalm, 1770). 
The arrival of European colonizers brought an extremist extractive mindset that failed to account for the long-term 
consequences of exploiting the land and its resources, as was noted with concern by visiting Finnish-Swedish 
botanist Pehr Kalm (Kalm, 1770). The Doctrine of Discovery enabled Christian appropriation of Indigenous lands, 
resulting in dispossession, ecological disruption, and the destruction of communal resources (Upstander Project, 
2023).  
The violent imposition of this privatized European economy in the 17th century introduced a capitalist trade and 
extraction-production structure that replaced Indigenous cultural systems, which centered a shared commons. It 
marked a shift from a society founded in Indigenous practices of “tending the wild” for sustenance and regeneration to 
a society where resources were harnessed primarily for their “exchange value” (K. Anderson, 2005; Bollier, 2013). 
Locale by locale, overexploitation depleted the massive oyster banks, disrupted fish runs, and contaminated 
groundwaters. 
European settlers used extended credit for rum and other European goods to addict and lock Indigenous people in 
debt, and then used that debt to justify seizing Indigenous assets. In addition, the monetization of wampum gifting 
disrupted inter-Indigenous social dynamics; some Indigenous groups began demanding tribute in the form of 
wampum from other groups, even threatening to use violence if they failed to comply. The European trade of 
wampum also accelerated the depletion of beavers and other animals coveted for their fur.  
In the 1630s and 1640s, English and Dutch settlers turned to an even more vicious strategy to occupy and gain land 
from Indigenous communities and crush resistance. There were at least nine colonial attacks in the region in the span 
of a decade that can be defined as genocidal massacres—unnecessary, indiscriminate killing of human beings, 
including children and pregnant women (Anonymous, 2013; Bailyn, 2013, p. 336; Brodhead, 1871, p. 391; de Vries, 
2020, p. 173; Jameson, 2000; Melyn, 1850; O’Callaghan, 1848; van der Donck & van Tienhoven, 1856). Murder and 
subjugation became a regular economic development policy. 
Beginning with the British mercenary-led Pequot War at Mystic, which paved the way for British conquest of much of 
Connecticut and parts of Long Island, followed by Dutch massacres at Corlears Hook (in present day Lower East 
Side), Pavonia (in present day Jersey City), Pound Ridge (in present day Westchester) and other settlements (Figure 
4), the violence set off a series of battles between settlers and Indigenous peoples and would, over time, lead to 
further Indigenous land dispossession.

Herein the Dutch and the British established a massive global economy based on an interlocking set of relations 
between money, power, and people spanning four continents (Lowe, 2015; Tchen, 2001). Imperial trade relied 
heavily on the extraction of resources from the so-called New World using these taken lands and forced labor, which 
escalated the demand for enslaved Indigenous people and Africans. When the English acquired New York and East 
and West Jersey from the Dutch in 1664, the shift further intensified the demand for slaves. Enslaved African people 
were brought to the region and forced to farm the fields formerly planted by Indigenous people and clear away forest 
to make more fields (Matthews, 2019, p. 9). The labor of enslaved people fueled the city’s economy, while the 
concentration of lands and wealth in the hands of a few exacerbated social inequalities.  
By the late eighteenth-century, many living beings in the region were depleted, including beavers, oysters, and 
whales. Extensive deforestation to clear land for agriculture and to produce fuel and building materials for the 
developing colonial cities had also destroyed atmosphere stabilizing carbon sinks (Cronon, 2003, p. 178). The 
ditching of tidal wetlands started as early as the 1600s to alter hydrology and optimize the production of salt hay and 
other products (Adamowicz et al., 2020; Dahl & Allord, 1996). In 1791, The Society for Establishing Useful 
Manufactures (SUM) was established by Alexander Hamilton to use the Great Falls at Paterson, NY, a longstanding 
site for Lunaape, to harness and eventually sell the waterpower to manufacturers (Cowen & Sylla, 2018). Additionally, 
alterations to waterways through canal construction and marshland reclamation disrupted wetlands, leading to 
increased flooding, erosion, and the loss of wetland habitats. Over the ensuing decades ,the Passaic River and the 
adjacent estuarial region became prime manufacturing real estate. Commodifying drained land accelerated the 
industrialization and pollution west of Manhattan Island – a pattern of land use development already established by 
King Charles II’s massive state drainage policies (Mulry, 2021). These adapted US practices not only resulted in loss 
of biodiversity and the disruption of ecosystems, but also set the stage for the Industrial Revolution in the US. The 
fossil fuel emissions from this era now account for the historic accumulation of US emissions, the largest of any 
nation, still lingering in the atmosphere. 
We cannot disregard the ways Dutch, English, and US abuses of the land have made the region and the planet more 
vulnerable to climate change. Furthermore, that settler-colonial, extremist extractive mindset continues to shape our

society today. Ecological and environmental injustices persist, with Indigenous peoples, people of color, and low-
income neighborhoods most affected (The Climate Reality Project, 2021; U.S. EPA Office of Land and Emergency 
Management, 2020). Marginalized communities are now at risk for the worst impacts of climate change (McDonald et 
al., 2021, tbl. S4; U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2021).  
Eco-colonialism in the New York metro region is a legacy that will impact everyone in the bioregion and on the planet. 
It is not only prudent but also the moral duty of policymakers in our region today to recognize this inheritance and to 
address the inequities and ecological ruin perpetuated by systems that prioritized and fostered wealth accumulation. 
3.1.3 
Learning from the history and the historical stewards of the land  
Climate change in NYC and its bioregion cannot be divorced from the history of colonialism, extractivism, and 
slavery. Understanding the impacts of these legacies is vital for formulating effective policies and strategies to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, knowledge of our history also necessitates a commitment to 
restorative justice.  
Indigenous peoples of North and South America have endured centuries of genocidal violence, leading to the 
extinction of over 2,000 nations (LaDuke, 2016, p. 1). Despite this immense loss, today there are still at least 3.7 
million Indigenous people in the United States, or a total of 9.7 million people when including those who identify as 
both “American Indian/Alaskan Native” and another racial group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). While many of the 
original people of our bioregion have been dislocated to other parts of the U.S., some remain on the lands they have 
called home for centuries, including but not limited to the Ramapough Munsee Lunaape and the Sand Hill people of 
present-day New Jersey (The Public History Project, 2023). Both have recognition from the state of New Jersey but 
no federal recognition from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Meanwhile, the Shinnecock, who received federal recognition 
in 2010, continue to own and occupy aboriginal homelands on the eastern end of Long Island (Shinnecock Nation, 
n.d.). Indigenous people of diverse nations from throughout the country have also made NYC their home. The city 
has the largest concentration of Indigenous peoples in the U.S., with the Manhattan-based American Indian 
Community House serving people from 72 nations (“About The American Indian Community House,” n.d.; First 
Peoples | The New York State Museum, n.d.).  
 Far from being “erased,” Indigenous groups in our bioregion and in North America at large continue to struggle for 
the return of land to Indigenous sovereignty (NDN Collective, 2021). A true commitment to principles of equity and 
justice require that today’s policymakers take seriously Indigenous movements for the right to steward their original 
homelands and for greater consent in decisions that impact their access to sustainable food, shelter, and more 
(Thompson, 2020).   
Thinking locally, it may seem challenging to conceptualize how to bring a crowded, acutely privatized city like New 
York back into the hands of the Lunaape, especially given the dislocation of many Lunaape people and the 
Indigenous diversity of present-day NYC. Yet Indigenous advocates and allies are already articulating steps worthy of 
consideration. For instance, in Shinnecock Bay off the coast of Long Island, members of the Shinnecock, working 
with the Sisters of St. Joseph, have developed a kelp farm that is helping to absorb the excess carbon and nitrates in 
the water while also providing the Shinnecock with green jobs and a return to stewarding their coastal waters. 
Collaborating with knowledgeable Indigenous stewards has the dual benefit of respecting Indigenous sovereignty 
demands while also addressing our city’s environmental issues and caring for our vulnerable coastal areas (Kleczek, 
2023; Leonard, 2021). In addition, the city can explore furthering investment in land stewardship models like the 
community land trust, which privileges a community’s needs—whether for affordable housing or climate resiliency 
infrastructure—over an individual’s potential to generate wealth (Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, 2023; NDN 
Collective, 2021; Thompson, 2020; United States Census Bureau, 2022). Policy-makers—and the public—must also 
be open to learning from Indigenous Land education (McCoy et al., 2017; Tuck et al., 2014). Those still on homelands 
possess profound insights into the bioregions they inhabit. Indigenous practices offer alternative models of relating to 
the land that ensures the well-being of both humans and our shared natural world and that can help us address the 
root causes of our disconnection from the environment and seek solutions for an inclusive, biodiverse future (United 
States Census Bureau, 2022). Collaborating with Indigenous communities and integrating these fundamental, 
embodied, long-memory insights into political decision-making processes can pave the way for more just and 
ecologically conscious policy approaches to climate action.  
3.2 
Historical and Contemporary Land Use Patterns and Climate Risk 
Historical land use decisions contribute to climate risk today and to who bears that risk. Working to eliminate 
inequities in climate risk requires understanding this more recent history, as well as the ongoing practices that 
perpetuate them. There are clear linkages between past land use and present climate risk; at the same time, the 
characteristics of this relationship depend on local histories and context.  Nevertheless, common themes emerge and 
can help explain patterns in New York today. To explore these relationships across a range of land use issues—

22 
including zoning, development decisions, geography, and transportation—this section will use the following 
framework (See Figure 5). Past land use practices affect climate risk directly and indirectly through how they affect 
current land use patterns and social vulnerability. In turn, these climate risks also shape land use patterns.  
■ 
Past land use practices affect climate risk directly. For example, formerly industrial areas may still have 
contaminated soil or other health risks. Often, the areas develop into low-income residential neighborhoods 
because the land is relatively inexpensive. The residents are then more exposed to toxic contaminants during 
extreme weather events, such as storm surges.  
■ 
Past land use practices affect current land use patterns, which affect climate risk. Redlined 
neighborhoods typically have developed over time to have higher rates of impervious surfaces and less 
investment in green space, resulting in intensified heat waves.  
■ 
A combination of current land use patterns and climate risk affects future land use patterns. Low-
income, high-elevation neighborhoods may see rising property values that lead to displacement and other 
changes in residential patterns. 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Framework for the relationship between Historic and Present Land Uses, Climate Risk, and Social Vulnerability |   
Although many studies use a social vulnerability lens to understand each of these categories individually, such as 
showing that people of color face greater heat wave-related mortality in New York (Madrigano et al., 2015), fewer 
studies empirically lay out these series of relationships: past land use practices produce social vulnerability, leading 
to specific climate vulnerabilities, leading to future land use patterns with their own inequities. Notably, the Madrigano 
study used multiple factors spanning demographics and the physical environment to assess heat wave-related 
mortality risk. This led to a composite Heat Vulnerability Index that NYC has continued to use and refine (City of New 
York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022a). 
The following sections will map out the state of the research across each of these relationships. 
3.2.1 
Zoning, land use planning, and climate risks 
Zoning and land use planning have been powerful tools for creating and enforcing racial and class segregation in 
U.S. urban areas, including suburban neighborhoods within and surrounding city boundaries (Whittemore, 2021). In 
addition to these socio-demographic consequences, zoning also determines many physical characteristics of 
communities, such as where hazards are located, who has access to green space, tree canopy cover, and 
development patterns.

3.2.1.1 
Redlining 
Old government maps by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) outlined neighborhoods in more than 
200 U.S. cities and rated them for inclusion in government home mortgage and lending programs (Aaronson, Faber, 
et al., 2021; Aaronson, Hartley, et al., 2021). These color-coded maps rated (and marked) neighborhoods from least 
risky to most risky — “A” through “D”; the “D” areas (red) were neighborhoods where Black residents lived. This 
practice is referred to as “redlining.” The result was that Black homeowners could not qualify for home loans that were 
backed by government insurance programs, essentially zoning out Black neighborhoods from investment (Aaronson, 
Faber, et al., 2021; Aaronson, Hartley, et al., 2021). As such, while “redlining” was not technically a land use policy, 
the practice operated like a zoning map, designating areas where Blacks and whites could and should live based on 
their ability to secure a mortgage and other financing. 
One consequence of governments and private entities’ disinvesting in redlined neighborhoods over time is that these 
areas, even today, lack heat- and flood-mitigating infrastructure relative to neighborhoods with higher HOLC grades 
(Hoffman et al., 2020; Wilson, 2020).  At the same time, redlining and other discriminatory housing policies (such as 
racial covenants) precluded people of color from moving to areas with fewer environmental risks and more resilient 
features. Although there is mixed evidence on to what extent formerly redlined areas have retained their original 
demographic composition (R. Best & Mejia, 2022; Perry & Harshbarger, 2019), many low-income residents and 
residents of color continue to live in formerly redlined areas today.  
In NYC, spatial inequities have changed over time due to population migration, upzoning, urban renewal, and 
displacement–all making the influence of redlining and other historical land use issues more complex and less direct 
(City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2020). Although HOLC deemed 54 percent of Manhattan’s land area as 
“hazardous” in the 1930s, some of these areas are now affluent neighborhoods; this relationship is further 
complicated by the neighborhoods’ high but uneven prevalence of air conditioning, making redlining even less of a 
predictor for heat vulnerability today (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2021b; Not Even 
Past, n.d.). 
Nevertheless, formerly redlined neighborhoods appear to be more likely than non-redlined neighborhoods to be 
facing high flood risk, disproportionately impacting households of color (Katz, 2021). These discrepancies are much 
larger in a handful of U.S. metros, including Sacramento, New York, Boston and Chicago (Katz, 2021). In NYC, 
census tracts that had been graded “A” or “B” have significantly lower flood risk under four scenarios—extreme and 
deep contiguous flooding, extreme nuisance flooding, moderate deep and contiguous flooding, and moderate 
nuisance flooding—than those with “C” and “D” grades (Steinberg-McElroy et al., Forthcoming).  
Moreover, these disparate risks are increasingly being quantified. One analysis of Los Angeles, California, found that 
between 197,000 and 874,000 people—and between $36 and $108 billion in property—within the 100-year floodplain 
are exposed to flooding greater than 30 centimeters (about 11.81 in), disproportionately so in non-Hispanic Black 
communities (Sanders et al., 2022).  An earlier study of NYC found that the non-Hispanic Black population in 100-
year floodplain (relative to what is expected based on population size) was nearly 60 percent higher in Manhattan, 40 
percent higher in the Bronx, and nearly 100 percent higher in Queens, whereas the Non-Hispanic White population 
was approximately 100 percent higher in the Bronx and 40 percent higher in Brooklyn. The authors of the study 
attribute these differences to past and changing land use patterns (Maantay & Maroko, 2009; Not Even Past, n.d.). 
The history of redlining also contributes to inequities in disaster protection and recovery funding. For example, 
redlining has led to lower property values, which can result in fewer government flood-protection funds (Katz, 2021). 
It’s worth noting that these lower-valued properties often retain disproportionately higher property tax assessments 
relative to their actual market values, thus increasing the financial burden on low-income people (Center for Municipal 
Finance, n.d.; Editorial Board, 2021). Some federal flood mitigation grants for homeowners require matching, often 
making them unaffordable particularly for residents who have not been able to build wealth through homeownership 
(Dorazio, 2022). Inequities in disaster relief also stem from many aspects of redlining: homes are likely less resilient 
to natural disasters and face more damage; lower property values result in fewer funds to cover damage; and a lack 
of previous repairs means that properties may not be eligible for certain programs (Dorazio, 2022; Sturgis, 2018). 
Climate risk today—particularly with respect to climate gentrification—may influence how these spatial inequities 
continue to evolve. One study suggests that outmigration can concentrate low-income households in flood zones. 
When the housing market experiences a drop in demand and prices, high-income people who can accept lower offers 
leave the neighborhood, while only low-income people are able to stay—or even move into the neighborhood (de 
Koning & Filatova, 2020). 
3.2.1.2 
Exclusionary zoning  
Historically, zoning regulations that favored single-family homes and larger lot sizes were designed to make 
neighborhoods less accessible and more exclusive (Trounstine, 2018).  For this reason, single-family zoning is often 
referred to as “exclusionary zoning” because it emerged as a way to keep racial and ethnic minority groups out of the 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
24 
suburbs after explicit racial zoning was found to be unconstitutional (Trounstine, 2018). The exclusionary nature of 
many suburbs meant that low-income residents of color, including those who live in NYC, were locked out of these 
neighborhoods and consigned to segregated neighborhoods in the city (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2020). 
From a climate justice perspective, many of the places contributing to greenhouse gas emissions the most (per 
person), including the suburbs of New York, are more protected from climate impacts, while also receiving the most 
renewable energy and electric vehicle subsidies. According to one report, households in New York metropolitan area 
suburbs and exurbs have emissions footprints that are two to three times as large as those in parts of Brooklyn or 
Manhattan (Plumer, 2022).  Residents of compact neighborhoods in the city, and particularly low-income residents, 
have a lower carbon footprint because of the density and everything it enables, such as public transit and walkability 
(Popovich et al., 2022). 
Many suburbs have also remained greener and, therefore, cooler, and environmentally healthier due to policies that 
perpetuate exclusion today, such as single-family zoning, and a lack of enforcement of fair housing laws. When 
higher-risk geographies have lower housing costs, rapidly growing urban areas may develop these areas to 
accommodate a growing population. For example, one study of Austin, Texas, found that low property prices caused 
the proportion of low-income residents living in floodplains to increase between 1990 and 2000 (Lee & Jung, 2014). 
Since this is an emerging body of literature, more research is needed to understand how repeated climate shocks 
affect displacement and whether residents are more likely to move to areas of sprawl.  
3.2.1.3 
Hazardous and industrial land uses 
Historically, zoning policies for industrial and hazardous land uses have either targeted less expensive land or 
reduced land value. Hazardous and industrial land uses are intertwined with segregation and expulsive zoning 
practices, resulting in greater exposure to certain pollutants in communities of color. Expulsive zoning targets low-
income communities and communities of color with noxious uses, which not only expand industrial zones but also 
accelerate gentrification in nearby neighborhoods that do not have these uses. In 2022, the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development found that the city of Chicago has been instrumental in efforts to move industrial 
facilities from predominantly white to predominantly non-white neighborhoods—one example of how governments 
continue to use zoning and land use policies to intentionally facilitate environmental injustice (Nexus Media News, 
2022).  
Historically, under expulsive zoning, low-income people and people of color were disproportionately displaced to the 
more industrial neighborhoods or became unable to afford to move out of these neighborhoods (Maantay, 2002). 
Today, predominantly low-income neighborhoods remain more likely to be targeted for, or to host, environmental 
hazards (Mizutani, 2018). One recent study, for example, finds that racially segregated residential areas are more 
strongly associated with fine particulate metals from human activity (such as industrial emissions, vehicle engines 
and shipping emissions) than natural sources (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b; 
Kodros et al., 2022). Higher-income, predominantly white populations may move away from newly introduced 
hazards, leaving lower-income residents with the greatest exposure. Additionally, these racially segregated 
residential areas also often have higher incidences of air pollution and urban heat island. See NPCC4, Matte et al 
(Matte et al., 2024). 
Legacy pollutants common in current or formerly industrial zones persist in the soil and can be released during 
flooding and storms (Marlow et al., 2022), reflecting how past land use decisions directly affect residents’ climate and 
environmental health risks today. Storms may increase contaminant transport near Superfund sites (2019), and two 
million people in the U.S. live within a mile of Superfund sites in areas prone to flooding or vulnerable to sea-level rise 
(Dearen et al., 2017). A review of sites within six metro areas found that socially vulnerable groups (taking into 
account demographics, socioeconomic status, and housing status) were disproportionately likely to live in areas with 
elevated flooding risks near former industrial sites. (Marlow et al., 2022). Moreover, more than 9,000 current federally 
subsidized housing properties currently sit within a mile of a Superfund site (Caputo & Lerner, 2021). 
Indirectly, these past land use decisions can affect land use patterns today, which then have implications for climate 
risk. In New York, the creation of official Significant Maritime and Industrial Areas (SMIAs) in 1992 has resulted in the 
further siting and clustering of environmental hazards in predominantly low-income communities of color. These 
areas were created to encourage the protection and siting of industrial and maritime uses along the waterfront. 
Historically, industrial land was often on the waterfront due to the city’s shipping history and low-income residents 
were often placed in public housing in industrial areas or moved there because of the availability of low-cost housing.  
One study finds that all six3 SMIAs are in hurricane storm surge zones, leading to greater risks for residents in these 
 
 
3 There are now seven SMIAs.

25 
neighborhoods (Bautista, Hanhardt, et al., 2015) 4. According to this study, the creation of SMIAs also resulted in the 
further siting and clustering of environmental hazards in predominantly low-income communities of color. 
At the same time, as neighborhoods shift away from hazardous and industrial uses, zoning decisions today can 
influence who bears greater risks of both climate impacts and climate gentrification in the future. When areas have 
transitional land uses and flexible zoning, combined with low exposure to climate impacts, they may be more likely to 
experience new development (Tedesco et al., 2022). These land use decisions not only affect neighborhoods 
differently but also the populations within each neighborhood. In the case of brownfield redevelopment in Manhattan, 
neighborhoods with certain amenities (such as waterfront property and public transit) experienced increased 
gentrification. The rising costs of living had the greatest impact on the elderly, renters, and those using government 
assistance (Pearsall, 2010). 
3.2.2 
Development and investment decisions 
Development decisions have long-term repercussions. Similarly, investments in resilience, and disparities in those 
investments, have been a direct result of historical and modern-day land use decisions. Today, these types of 
investments play a role in climate gentrification. Large-scale investments in climate adaptation and resilience—
ranging from green infrastructure to seawalls to buyouts—affect the development landscape and the climate 
riskscape.  
3.2.2.1 
Housing development 
Large building complexes (including many federally subsidized buildings) were typically placed in areas with 
inexpensive land, which continue to be more affordable neighborhoods today. These buildings and their related 
infrastructure were constructed with heat-absorbing materials that intensify the urban heat island effect, continuing to 
disproportionately impact the predominantly low-income residents (Hoffman et al., 2020). In addition to the 
environmental effects of the construction materials, low-income renters of color are more likely to live in housing that 
is older, substandard, and less maintained; these quality issues increase the risk of structural collapse and damage to 
people and properties during extreme weather events (Burby et al., 2003; Cash et al., 2020; Fussell, 2015; Krause & 
Reeves, 2017; Rosenbaum, 1996). Moreover, housing continues to be built in riskier areas and with less resilient 
materials, including new construction of affordable housing (Hammett et al., 2018; Mervosh, 2019; Uhlmann, 2018). 
In NYC, these effects are not as straightforward. Although densely developed neighborhoods with masonry and steel 
apartment buildings do have higher overnight minimum outdoor temperatures (Eliezer et al., 2019), the same 
structures can reduce heat exposure in several ways: by gaining heat more slowly (Urban Green Council, 2014); by 
being more energy efficient and having lower energy costs than single-family homes (U.S. Department of Energy 
Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, n.d.); by having less exposure to outdoor heat or cold due to 
adjacent unit walls (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2013); and, by helping to shade streets and sidewalks, 
thereby reducing daytime surface temperatures relative to outer boroughs (City of New York, n.d., 2021). 
Multifamily buildings constructed with masonry and steel are more able to survive flooding than single-family homes 
with wood frames, as illustrated by the storm surge during Hurricane Sandy (Sandy Regional Assembly, 2013). 
However, residents of larger buildings were still affected by damage to electrical, heating, elevator, and water supply 
systems and would benefit from flood hardening and other resilience strategies (Lane et al., 2013). 
The development of public and affordable housing also has a distinct relationship with climate vulnerability. 
Inexpensive land tends to be located in areas of environmental risk, which contributes to the government’s decision to 
place public housing in these geographies. One early study of floodplain areas in Austin found that such areas have 
been developed for multi-family housing, mobile homes, and single-family housing in low-income neighborhoods 
between 1990 and 2000 (Lee & Jung, 2014). More recent studies continue to document the relationship between 
flooding risks and affordable housing. In fact, approximately 9 percent of all subsidized or public housing projects in 
the US are in 100-year or 500-year floodplains (Mervosh, 2019; Peri et al., n.d.; Rosoff & Yager, 2017) and the 
number of affordable units exposed to flooding and sea level rise in the United States is projected to more than triple 
by 2050 (Buchanan et al., 2020). Coastal states are estimated to have at least some affordable housing units 
exposed to flood risk events at least four times year, with the most vulnerable cities highly concentrated along the 
northeastern corridor and in California (Buchanan et al., 2020). In some of these cities, over 90 percent of their 
 
 
4 This pattern does not always hold. For example, contaminants can also exist in neighborhoods that have undergone significant 
land use and demographic change. In New Orleans, formerly industrial sites have been converted to other uses, most commonly in 
predominantly White neighborhoods. (Frickel & Elliott, 2008)

relatively smaller affordable housing stocks are expected to be exposed to flooding. However, the study finds, NYC 
remains the most vulnerable in absolute terms (Buchanan et al., 2020). 
In New York, 17 percent of the New York City Housing Authority’s buildings are in the 100-year floodplain or Special 
Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), and this is expected to rise to 26 percent over the next few decades due to sea level rise 
(Yeung & Levers, 2022). NYCHA’s Climate Adaptation Plan recognizes the need to prioritize the protection of critical 
infrastructure in these developments (New York City Housing Authority, 2023). Additionally, not all areas that flood 
are within FEMA-designated floodplains (See NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al., (Rosenzweig et al., 2024)).  
In addition to the impact of housing development decisions on climate risk, disasters have a range of inequitable 
consequences for housing. Redeveloping public housing into mixed-income units after a disaster exacerbates the 
existing shortage of public housing units, as happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina; this also shapes 
whether residents can (or want to) return as their neighborhood changes (Fessler, 2015). These changes can also 
emerge over time. After Hurricane Katrina, the neighborhoods that were slower to recover—which typically also had 
greater social vulnerability—became the fastest growing neighborhoods in the early 2010s, with gentrification being 
one factor in the newly accelerated growth (Peacock et al., 2014). Plus, the housing shortages after disasters—even 
without redevelopment—and the resulting rise in prices can play a role in neighborhood change (Fussell et al., 2010; 
Peacock et al., 2014). 
3.2.2.2 
Buyouts  
Similarly, buyout programs initiated in response to repeated disasters have a variety of disparate impacts on low-
income residents and residents of color (Kraan et al., 2021).  
Although nationally wealthier counties have implemented more buyouts, the affected properties within those counties 
tend to have lower incomes and greater racial diversity (Mach et al., 2019). One study finds that whiter counties and 
neighborhoods have more access to federal buyout assistance, but homeowners in neighborhoods of color are more 
likely to accept that assistance (Elliott et al., 2020). This helps to explain why non-white neighborhoods in 
predominantly white counties see the greatest demolition (Elliott et al., 2020). In another study, the majority of FEMA-
funded buyouts were found to be located outside of zones that HOLC had assessed. For the areas HOLC had graded 
in historic urban cores, most buyouts were located in redlined districts (Zavar & Fischer, 2021). In addition to 
inequities in the buyout process itself, other issues include unequal access to information about the process, 
dislocation from social networks, and relocation costs.  
Buyouts may also facilitate racial segregation. One recent study that traced the path of over ten thousand federally 
funded buyouts across the country finds that retreating homeowners in majority-white neighborhoods are willing to 
endure 30% higher flood risk before selling to the government and relocating than homeowners in majority Black 
neighborhoods.  The study also finds that white families in neighborhoods that utilize FEMA buyout money move to 
wealthier and whiter areas, while residents of majority-minority neighborhoods were more likely to move to 
neighborhoods that are majority-Black or majority-Hispanic (Elliott & Wang, 2023). 
At the same time, wealthier, whiter communities are more likely to receive support for seawalls, funding to elevate 
homes, or drainage infrastructure (Nance et al., 2022; Siders & Keenan, 2020). Without this protective infrastructure, 
residents in low-income communities may want buyouts. However, when properties are undervalued during the 
appraisal process, people who want to move may not be considered eligible for some buyout programs despite the 
climate risks they face. Equity issues with benefit-cost analysis methods can compound concerns about buyouts (See 
NPCC4, Balk et al, (Balk, McPhearson, et al., 2024)). To qualify for federal FEMA funds, the cost of flooding must 
exceed the cost of acquisition and demolition, which can disproportionately exclude residents of neighborhoods with 
low land values (Patterson, 2018). FEMA has introduced an alternative method for determining cost-effectiveness, 
but the impact remains to be evaluated (Association of State Floodplain Managers, 2022; Siders, 2019). Without 
transparency around buyout decision-making processes, residents do not know how home values are being 
appraised or how the buyouts are being allocated, leading to the feeling that relocation is the only financially viable 
option being offered (Shi et al., 2022). Although buyouts are intended to reduce vulnerability to climate impacts, this 
outcome is not guaranteed without significant changes to those programs (Kraan et al., 2021). 
Moreover, in hot housing markets, many people cannot afford a comparable home and may not be able to move to a 
less risky neighborhood (Shi et al., 2022).  One study of a buyout program in New York after Hurricane Sandy, the 
New York Rising Buyout and Acquisition Program, found that 20 percent of households studied relocated to an area 
with exposure to coastal flood hazards. And 99 percent relocated to an area with higher social vulnerability (McGhee 
et al., 2020).

To better understand and address these types of issues, a series of workshops in 2022 discussed shared challenges, 
lessons learned, and recommendations for improving buyouts, including how they can be fairer (Innovations in 
Buyouts Workshops, n.d.). Additional work will continue to be needed to prevent and remedy the inequities to which 
buyouts can and have contributed.  
3.2.2.3 
Resilience-promoting investments 
Disparities in parks (Rigolon et al., 2018), tree cover, and other green infrastructure investments contribute to 
inequities in climate risk and resilience. For example, one study finds that the public right-of-way has less tree cover 
in neighborhoods with higher proportions of residents who are Black, low-income, or renters (Landry & Chakraborty, 
2009). This is related to redlining nationally: in one study of 37 U.S. cities, formerly redlined areas (i.e., D graded) 
have about 23 percent tree canopy coverage, whereas areas with the highest grading (i.e., A and B) have about 43 
percent coverage today (Locke et al., 2021). Because higher HOLC grades are associated with significantly higher 
percentages of tree canopy coverage today, these neighborhoods not only can better mitigate urban heat and 
flooding but also gain health, aesthetic, and other benefits (Namin et al., 2020).  
These patterns, however, are not identical across cities. In Baltimore, Black residents have more access to parks 
within walking distance, but white residents have more acreage of parks within walking distance, which are less 
congested (Boone et al., 2009). Baltimore’s historical de jure segregation created predominantly black neighborhoods 
without park access until a period of white flight and suburbanization changed settlement patterns throughout 
Baltimore, resulting in Black residents living closer to the parks from which they had previously been excluded. 
Contextualizing current land use patterns is critical for understanding the impact of amenities over time. 
Access to parks within walking distance in NYC is relatively robust, with nearly 99% of New Yorkers residing within a 
10-minute walk of a park, according to a recent study by the Trust for Public Land (Rozon, 2023). However, the ability 
to reach larger parks is more limited without a car, and fewer of these areas are transit-accessible or near public and 
affordable housing. As such, according to the study, in New York, residents living in neighborhoods of color have 
access to 32% less nearby park space than those living in white neighborhoods and residents living in lower-income 
neighborhoods have access to 19% less nearby park space than those in higher-income neighborhoods. Moreover, a 
report from Natural Areas Conservancy found that natural areas are significantly cooler than the rest of the city, and 
so disparities in park access have consequences for heat exposure and health (Crown et al., 2023). 
Today, resilience-promoting investments can continue to create inequities through several channels, including 
maladaptation and climate gentrification. In one example of how maladaptation can increase physical risks, the 
protection of individual shoreline segments can increase flooding and damages in other areas, and in some cases 
regional flood damages (Hummel et al., 2021). Structural mitigation—as defined by physical construction or 
engineering to reduce or avoid impacts on structures, such as raising buildings—also raises the cost of coastal 
redevelopment, making coastal areas more expensive and more exclusive (Gould & Lewis, 2018). The demand for 
waterfront property in NYC continues to outweigh flooding concerns, leading to high demand real estate markets that 
are seen as better candidates for structural mitigation. The higher building costs are then passed on to those who can 
afford to live in and develop these neighborhoods (i.e., the resilience pathway of climate gentrification) (Gould & 
Lewis, 2018). However, in one example of equity-focused resilience-promoting investments, NYC’s Climate Strong 
Communities program aims to invest in infrastructure within vulnerable communities that have received fewer 
resiliency investments historically or post-Sandy (For more information on this program, see section 2.1). 
Resilience-promoting investments in multifamily affordable housing developments have the potential to address some 
of these inequities. For example, energy back-up systems–particularly those coupled with rooftop solar–can help 
residents vulnerable to climate impacts and their social-economic consequences maintain power during heat waves 
and coastal storms. Although residential clean energy subsidies have largely gone to more affluent households 
(Borenstein & Davis, 2016), there are currently efforts to bring the benefits of renewable energy–from phone charging 
to medical equipment to cooling and heating common rooms–to environmental justice communities within the city. 
Most of the benefits of green infrastructure go to areas with wealthier, whiter and better educated residents (Shokry et 
al., 2020), and parks are typically associated with gentrification processes (with the exception of historically Black 
post-industrial cities experiencing disinvestment and high rates of vacant land) (Triguero-Mas et al., 2022). Without 
anti-displacement strategies in place, resilience-promoting investments can have inequitable outcomes.  
3.2.3 
Geography and displacement 
Different geographies have advantages and disadvantages that affect land costs, amenities, and residential 
settlement patterns.

3.2.3.1 
Elevation 
Both historically and today, elevation has been a factor in land use decisions. However, the relationships among 
elevation, development, and social vulnerability depend on each locality’s social and environmental context. For 
example, inland cities tend to have residential patterns in which income correlates with elevation, but coastal cities 
see the reverse pattern (Ueland & Warf, 2006). Low-lying waterfronts may serve as an amenity that drives up land 
costs or as a disamenity because of its potential for industrial uses. For individual cities, context is key to 
understanding elevation as a factor in climate risk and who bears that risk today.  
In NYC, low-lying marshes were historically considered an environmental disamenity. Even after sanitation 
infrastructure was introduced, historical marsh sites have continued to be disproportionately low-income, with housing 
prices rising with distance from these sites (Villareal, 2013). One study suggests that relative elevation may better 
correlate with socioeconomic status in New York; it also recognizes that some high-elevation areas, such as in Staten 
Island, may also have unwanted land uses and predominantly low-income populations, potentially because these 
areas used to be more difficult to access (Brisbane, 2014). Even within NYC, these mixed patterns demonstrate how 
elevation can be a complex factor in land use decisions that does not have a straightforward relationship with social 
vulnerability. 
In some cities, climate impacts are making high elevation more desirable, leading to climate gentrification and 
displacement. Empirically, flood depth and lower ground elevation have been shown to be inversely associated with 
gentrification, causing higher-elevation neighborhoods to become significantly whiter and higher income (Aune et al., 
2020). In the example of Miami-Dade County, the rate of single-family home price appreciation is positively correlated 
with higher elevation, and price appreciation in the lowest-elevation cohorts have not kept up since 2000 (Keenan et 
al., 2018). The high-elevation neighborhood Little Haiti has historically had little investment but is now experiencing a 
development boom, partly because of its low land costs. The neighborhood is predominantly low-income and Black, 
and its rising housing prices are now displacing long-term residents (Campo-Flores & Kusisto, 2019; WLRN, 2019). 
The literature on climate gentrification and displacement is explored further in Section 4.1 below. 
Although elevation can contribute to land use and demographic patterns, there is a range of different evidence across 
contexts (and even within cities), with no straightforward or single explanation. When considering the effects of 
elevation in NYC, these relationships are equally nuanced.  
3.2.3.2 
Waterfronts and coasts 
In some cities, coasts serve as amenities that attract investment and have higher property values. Although wealthier 
residents in some cities may currently be more likely to live in these flood-prone areas, they also have more 
resources to cope with disruption and disasters (Collins et al., 2018). In New York, building codes for new housing 
were strengthened after Hurricane Sandy, making new development more resilient (even on the waterfront), but not 
necessarily more affordable. Like elevation, waterfronts and coasts have highly context-dependent effects on land 
use and climate risk.5 
However, the link between waterfronts and high-income residents has not always been a consistent pattern over 
time. In NYC, both the land uses and population associated with waterfronts have changed. For most of its history, 
the city’s low-lying waterfront was largely used for industrial purposes; it wasn’t until the 1960s that New York’s 
waterfront began to be reimagined as a recreational and/or residential space (Platt, 2009). Many of these areas were 
not rated by HOLC because, at the time, they were not residential. As they became desirable places for residential 
development (including some built on landfill, such as Battery Park City), plans for affordable housing have not kept 
up with market pressure (Jacobson, 2018). Today, New York's waterfront has become a special point of interest 
among environmental justice advocates, due to new high-end real estate developments on the waterfront which can 
displace local residents (Turan, 2018). 
3.2.4 
Transportation 
Transportation planning has implications for both land use patterns and climate risk. Access to transportation options 
and transportation infrastructure itself affects people’s capacity to evacuate, how much disruption they experience 
during and after disasters, and certain physical characteristics of their communities.  
 
 
5 One study takes this contextual approach to analyzing the process of racial coastal formation on Sapelo Island, Georgia. The 
authors identify land ownership, employment, and barriers to inclusion in adaptation planning as factors in vulnerability to seal-level 
rise on this waterfront.(Hardy et al., 2017)

29 
3.2.4.1 
Disruption and evacuation 
Transit disruption particularly affects communities with already-low access to transit, even if they are farther from the 
worst climate impacts (Faber, 2015). In addition to unequal access to public transit, renter, single-parent, low-income, 
and non-white households tend to have less access to personal vehicles—one factor in the slower and lower 
evacuation rates observed. (Living near congested city centers also plays a role in these rates) (Cutter & Emrich, 
2006; Van Zandt et al., 2012). 
These inequities are clear in New York: among all households in the lower quintile of income in the state, vehicle 
costs are 18 percent of income, on average; more affluent households have more vehicles, which comprise a smaller 
share of their income, and also have greater flexibility in hours and remote work (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
2021).  
Additionally, federal infrastructure policy continues to favor highways over infrastructure for transit. Even when transit 
infrastructure exists, it often faces its own climate vulnerabilities. The ongoing PROTECT program intends to address 
these vulnerabilities (Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation 
Program (PROTECT) | US Department of Transportation, n.d.). In NYC, 79 percent of transportation and utility land 
uses that support essential infrastructure—electric and gas utilities, rail yards, airports, docks and piers, bridges, 
tunnels, and highways—are in the 100-year floodplain (Yeung & Levers, 2022). These infrastructure vulnerabilities 
compound disruption and evacuation concerns. 
3.2.4.2 
Urban renewal 
Focusing on the transportation-related aspects of urban renewal, federally incentivized roadways were often built 
through low-income neighborhoods—including many redlined neighborhoods that were divided by highways—thereby 
increasing the amount of heat-absorbing land cover (Hoffman et al., 2020). Like the construction of housing or large 
complexes, these materials intensify the urban heat island effect in the immediate communities where they are 
located. The interplay between roadways, development, and redlining has a cumulative effect on how extreme heat 
becomes concentrated in low-income communities and communities of color. Another aspect of these linkages is that 
exclusionary zoning near suburban railway hubs has limited the stock of affordable, transit-accessible housing in 
metropolitan areas–again compounding the effects of housing discrimination, transportation inequities, and mobility to 
and from “greenlined” areas (Regional Plan Association (RPA), 2017). 
3.3 
Conclusion 
The research on historical land use patterns and present-day climate risk is growing (Table 4: Evidence-Supported 
Mechanisms Between Land Use, Climate Risk, and Social Vulnerability), but more research is needed on how these 
patterns and relationship influence social vulnerability in particular local contexts. As flood maps are updated and risk 
projections change, revisiting studies with new data will be useful. Although the relationships between historical land 
use and climate risk are complex and context-dependent, they often have similar underlying mechanisms, such as 
lower land costs in risky areas, eroded political capital in marginalized communities, race-based practices that are 
distinct from but often related to socioeconomic factors, and so on. Many of these land use issues—past and 
present—are related to and reinforce one another. Without intentional, anti-racist work toward climate mitigation, 
adaptation, and resilience, NYC will risk perpetuating these inequities in new forms. This requires several key 
approaches: 
1. 
Incorporating contextual equity and understanding the history of places down to the neighborhood level, 
2. 
taking a holistic approach to reducing racialized vulnerability to climate shocks, including inseparable issues 
like housing and transit access, and 
3. 
recognizing that the cost burdens of climate adaptation (e.g., higher energy costs, insurance premiums, 
relocation) affect people differently—particularly when considered alongside homeownership and wealth 
gaps—and can easily result in increased displacement risks.

4 Identifying Risks at the Intersection of Historical Patterns 
of Injustice and Climate Change 
Based on the above analysis of the ways that historical and contemporary land uses and a host of other factors 
shape the risks of populations in NYC, the NPCC investigated potential metrics that could be used to assess the 
ongoing vulnerability of local populations to climate change. In its last report, NPCC3 examined and assessed 
methodological approaches used for social vulnerability analysis and mapping in NYC and elsewhere. In this 
iteration, NPCC4 proposes to capture another dimension of social vulnerability to climate change: climate 
displacement. It is evident that displacement is projected to be one of the most devastating and widespread impacts 
of climate change (Cash et al., 2020; Melix et al., 2023). However, it is not always clear what the relationship is 
between social drivers of displacement—whether as the result of eviction, unaffordable housing costs, or poor-quality 
housing (Citizens Housing Planning Council (CHPC) of New York City, 2002; City of New York, 2023b) and climate 
risks and hazards. Fortunately, an emerging body of research has added to our understanding of the ways that 
climate impacts and adaptations may contribute to changes in community characteristics and potential displacement 
of vulnerable residents through interactions with social and economic drivers of displacement (K. Best & Jouzi, 2022). 
Understanding and quantifying the compounding effects of climate change, displacement, and socio-vulnerability is 
crucial for the ability of local governments to adopt mitigation and adaptation policies that do not entrench and further 
the kind of unjust land patterns and development that the previous sections detailed. In this section, we summarize 
the state of the science and research on climate gentrification, to situate the vulnerability of specific populations to 
displacement which results from a complex interaction of factors and forces. We then suggest that the City adopt a 
recently proposed Climate Displacement Social Vulnerability (CDSV) score that integrates socio-economic, climate 
risk, evictions, and housing data to better measure the risks of climate displacement at the census-tract level in NYC 
(Tedesco et al., 2024). If the City is able to measure the risks of climate displacement at an appropriate scale, such 
as at the neighborhood level, then it could determine whether and how new climate-resilient infrastructure or 
infrastructure investments might risk displacement and identify ways to mitigate that risk.  
4.1 
Defining and Understanding Climate Displacement and Gentrification 
Displacement is most often defined as the involuntary movement of an individual or family from their home or 
neighborhood. This definition has traditionally not included the ways that climate impacts and adaptations can 
contribute to displacement of vulnerable populations (Farbotko, 2019; J. K. Maldonado et al., 2014; Shokry et al., 
2020, 2022; Tedesco et al., 2022; Triguero-Mas et al., 2022), including bluelining (Fleming et al., 2022), and 
decreasing health conditions associated with climate hazards, such as flooding or heatwaves (Rocque et al., 2021). 
Several definitions have been used for climate displacement. However, as a general matter, climate displacement is 
understood as forced migration occurring entirely or partially from environmental events or from long-term changes 
related to climate change. (Tedesco et al, 2024). Connecting displacement and climate or environmental hazards is a 
complex task due to a multitude of environmental and climatic influences that impact the ability to stay in one place 
(Miller & Vu, 2021), to the relatively coarse spatial and temporal resolution of currently available datasets (de 
Sherbinin & Bardy, 2015), and because current assessment models miss the feedbacks among the socio-economic 
and climate systems (Rising et al., 2022).  
4.1.1 
Pathways to Climate Displacement 
Keenan et al. (2018), in one of the most cited works on this topic, identify three types of climate gentrification: the 
“superior investment pathway,” the “cost-burden pathway,” and the “resilience investment pathway.” Under the 
superior investment pathway, households move from high-risk geographies to low-risk ones in order to avoid climate 
hazards. This pathway is evident in Miami, Florida, for example, where price depreciation in coastal zones induce 
high- and moderate- income households to move into higher elevation areas, often displacing moderate- to low-
income households in historical communities of color (Keenan et al., 2018). The cost-burden pathway describes 
scenarios in which only high-income households can afford to remain in high-risk but desirable (usually coastal) 
areas. As the cost of insurance, repairs, taxes, etc. rise, moderate and low-income households are forced to leave 
these areas (Knuth, 2020). In the resilience investment pathway, low-income households are similarly displaced as 
an unintended consequence of public investments in adaptation, such as green infrastructure, that lead to rising 
property values  that price residents out (Shokry et al., 2020).  
As this climate gentrification and displacement literature has developed over the past five years, researchers have 
further complicated these pathways, recognizing that climate gentrification is a dynamic process that varies across 
contexts and may result from a combination of the above "pathways” Best & Jouzi and Black et al (2022; Black et al., 
2013), for example, characterize climate gentrification as “a multi-causal, multi-spatial process that involves

 Interim Report for Public Release 
32 
dimensions of both natural and human systems…[and] happens across global and regional scales spatially and from 
the past to future temporally.” Climate change has the potential to exacerbate other forces of displacement, such as 
neighborhood disinvestment, rising housing costs, and extreme weather events like flooding and heat (Gregg & 
Braddock, 2020). For example, Li & Grant (Li & Grant, 2022) find evidence that the major factor steering Miami  
homebuyers to higher ground are expensive flood insurance and the historical record of flooding, rather than scientific 
projections of sea level rise.  On the other hand, coastal residents migrate to high elevation neighborhoods like Little 
Haiti in Miami, a once redlined community starved of investment for decades and only now targeted for accelerated 
investment through tax incentive programs.   
4.1.2 
 Climate Displacement Metrics 
Researchers have used  a variety of measures to understand the potential drivers of climate displacement or 
gentrification: disproportionate price appreciation in high-elevation areas in Miami Dade County (Keenan et al., 2018); 
green resilient infrastructure siting and minority population in Philadelphia (Shokry et al., 2022); low-carbon 
infrastructure, housing prices, the number of lower-income and non-white residents in Seattle (Rice et al., 2019); and, 
agent-based modeling simulation of flood hazards and the outmigration of high-income households (de Koning & 
Filatova, 2020).  
Aune et al. (2020) move beyond these single measures and creates a gentrification index based on education level, 
population above the poverty limit, and median household income. The authors use the index to identify 
gentrification-eligible census tracts in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina. Of these tracts, the ones that did 
undergo gentrification by 2010 had experienced less flooding, were at higher elevations, and were more likely to have 
changed from majority black to majority white, among other demographic changes. The authors conclude that “High 
elevation, low-income, demographically transitional areas are at highest risk for future climate gentrification (Aune et 
al., 2020).” This study demonstrates the importance of examining how neighborhoods’ physical characteristics and 
gentrification pressures interact with disasters.  
Tedesco et al. (2022) develop another index, the Climate Gentrification Risk Index (CGRI), from data on rental 
properties, evictions, socioeconomic status, and environmental risk. The authors identify two neighborhoods, one in 
Miami and one in Tampa, with trends that are consistent with climate gentrification. In addition to previous studies’ 
focus on demographics and climate hazards, this analysis points to transitional land uses and flexible zoning in low-
exposure areas as potential drivers of climate gentrification.  
Best et al. (2023) use machine learning to categorize U.S. East Coast counties into four typologies of social, housing, 
and environmental vulnerability. The researchers interpret each cluster as being defined by the superior investment 
pathway, disinvestment, affordable development, and a mixed typology. However, they recognize that these larger-
scale patterns do not reflect heterogeneity within counties (such as at the tract level), and this method cannot speak 
to the exact relationship between climate change and gentrification.  
Melix et al. (2023) use principal components analysis to quantify displacement pressures , focusing on demographic, 
socioeconomic, sea-level rise, and housing. Each component represents a combination of variables (e.g., 
“neighborhoods with low job proximity scores and low proficiency schools”), which they use to identify neighborhoods 
at risk of climate displacement. They find that high-displacement risk areas in three Florida cities also tend to be 
inland, making them likely to receive migrants from coastal areas, and designated as opportunity zones–two factors 
that may accelerate climate gentrification processes and ultimately displacement.  
Finally, S. K. Kim & Park (2023) demonstrate that migration is responsive to climate risk, and that this migration to 
lower-risk areas leads to gentrification–in this case, both the in-migration of higher-income households and the out-
migration of lower-income households and people of color. Unlike previous studies, this analysis is able to causally 
connect climate change, migration, and displacement (rather than illustrating displacement alongside climate 
impacts). 
4.1.3 
Gaps and Opportunities 
From this body of literature, it is clear that climate displacement is a context-specific phenomenon that interacts with 
social, environmental, and land-use patterns. Displacement can happen alongside climate change, because of 
climate change, and intertwined with climate change. Displacement can result in the mobility of socially vulnerable 
populations to areas where they are likely to be more exposed to climate risks or are more socially vulnerable 
because they can only access less quality housing and neighborhoods. Displacement can occur on the heels of 
large-scale investments in climate adaptation and resilience —ranging from green infrastructure to seawalls to 
buyouts. Displacement often occurs when socially vulnerable and historically marginalized populations are priced out 
of a neighborhood or experience cultural displacement as neighborhood demographics and character changes. The

existing research illuminates some of these aspects of climate displacement, but a more holistic measure remains 
necessary. 
4.2 
Measuring Climate Displacement Vulnerability for New York City 
 Tedesco et al. (2024) propose a metric that integrates socio-economic vulnerability, climate risk, evictions, and 
housing data to better measure the risk of climate displacement at the neighborhood level in NYC. Unlike previous 
climate gentrification measures, it directly speaks to the multi-dimensional factors that can inform displacement risks. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that multiple climate hazards are studied in conjunction with displacement and 
socio-vulnerability for NYC. The CDSV is a starting point for future research on how to capture and assess the 
complex nature of climate displacement using multidimensional indices which are likely to lead a more robust 
evidence base to assess this risk in different areas of the country. Below we describe the proposed Climate 
Displacement Social Vulnerability (CDSV) score and assess its strengths and limitations as applied to NYC. 
4.2.1 
  Data and methods  
The proposed Climate Displacement and Socio-Vulnerability (CDSV) score for NYC (Tedesco et al., 2024) is 
designed to account for climate hazards, displacement risk, and social vulnerability factors based on publicly 
available datasets. These databases include the FEMA National Risk Index, New York City's Displacement Index, 
and the Social Vulnerability Index. Each is described below. The goal is to identify those areas where risk of the 
combination of the three factors is the highest (e.g., hotspots due to compounding effects). As such, for each climate 
hazard the CDSV score is computed from the linear combination of the three factors equally weighted in Equation 1 
4.2.1.1 
FEMA National Risk Index 
The Climate Score (ClimSc) is based on a national dataset created by FEMA, the National Risk Index (NRI), to 
identify communities most at risk of specific climate hazards (FEMA, 2023). The NRI combines the frequency of 
natural hazards with social factors and resilience capabilities. Of the 18 natural hazards, the CDSV for NYC applies 
the NRI to evaluate the following  hazard risks: 1) Coastal and 2) Fluvial Flooding; 3) Heatwaves; 4) Hurricanes and 
5) Winter Weather (winter storm events in which the main types of precipitation are snow, sleet, or freezing rain). 
These hazards were chosen by Tedesco et al, (2024) because they have been previously identified as priority climate 
hazards for the City. One caution that the researchers note regarding the Climate Score (ClimSc), is that because it is 
based on national data set, it  is not a substitute for more granular localized investigations of hazard risks that are 
available (see for example, NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al (2024) which presents more detailed discussion of coastal and 
fluvial flooding hazards). As a reference Figure 6 shows an example of the FEMA National Risk Index ranking for the 
five selected hazards in the CDSV for NYC.

4.2.1.2 
NYC displacement risk dataset 
The Displacement Score (DispSc) is constituted from displacement risk data obtained from the NYC Department of 
City Planning (City of New York Department of City Planning & City of New York Housing Preservation and 
Development, 2023). NYC defines displacement as the “involuntary movement of an individual or family from their 
home or neighborhood, whether as the result of eviction, unaffordable housing costs, or poor-quality housing”. The 
NYC displacement risk builds on variables listed in Local Law 78 (Local Law 78, 2021), which requires an online 
citywide equitable development data tool including data from six categories, disaggregated by race and ethnicity. 
Specifically, the Displacement Index uses three categories of data: Population Vulnerability, Housing Conditions, and 
Market Pressure. Population Vulnerability refers to the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of a 
neighborhood's residents that may make them more susceptible to displacement. It includes factors such as 
race/ethnicity, income, and the share of a household's income spent on rent. Housing Conditions refer to the 
characteristics of housing in a neighborhood that can either help stabilize households or lead to greater instability. It 
includes variables such as the condition of the housing stock, whether a household rents or owns, and applicability of 
various programs or regulations limiting rent increases. Market Pressure refers to the broader conditions affecting 
neighborhoods that tend to make it harder for lower-income residents to remain or find new housing in the area and 
includes data points related to changes in the housing market and demographic composition of a neighborhood, 
among others.  
The data is generated at the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) scale, a statistical area defined by the US Census 
(United States Census Bureau, 2023c). PUMAs in NYC generally approximate Community Districts, of which there 
are 59 (Tedesco et al., 2024).  The Displacement Risk Map, which is not broken down by race and ethnicity, is 
generated at a smaller geography, Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA) (City of New York Department of City 
Planning, 2023a). NTAs are groupings of census tracts that are designed to approximate neighborhoods. The index 
is obtained through the incorporation of several data sources that are surveys, such as the American Community 
Survey (ACS) (United States Census Bureau, 2023a) and the Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS) (United States 
Census Bureau, 2023b), meaning the data are based on a sample and there is a margin of error (MOE) associated 
with each data estimate.   As an example, Figure 7a shows the displacement risk used in this study. As in the case of 
FEMA NRI, the CDSV score for NYC converts the displacement risk categories into numerical values using the 
following correspondence: Very Low = 0; Relatively Low = 25; Intermediate = 50; Relatively High= 75; Very High= 
100. We name this the Displacement Score (DsipSc).  
4.2.1.3 
SOVI 
For  the socio-vulnerability score (SOVISc) the CDSV uses the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) (Cutter et al., 2003). 
The index synthesizes 29 socioeconomic variables, which the research literature suggests contribute to reduction in a 
community’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards. The data are compiled and processed by 
the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina and are standardized and placed 
into a principal components analysis to reduce the initial set of variables into a smaller set of statistically optimized 
components (HVRI Data and Resources - College of Arts and Sciences | University of South Carolina, n.d.). The 
CDSV normalizes the SoVI score value between 0 and 100 over the NYC area (Figure 7b).  
 
Figure 7: Displacement (a) and SOVI (b) scores over NYC. The SOVI score is normalized to the NYC values.

4.2.1.4 
Computation of the Climate, Displacement and Socio-Vulnerability (CDSV) score 
For each climate hazard e the CDSV score is computed from the linear combination of the three factors equally 
weighted in Equation 1 (Tedesco et al., 2024): 
CDSVi = (ClimSci +  DispSc +  SOVISc)/3 
 
Equation 1: Climate, Displacement and Socio-Vulnerability (CDSV) Score. Vi is the specific natural hazard. DispSC is displacement 
score based on the NYC Displacement Risk dataset. SOVISc is SOVI score based on (Cutter et al., 2003). 
 The subscript i refers to the specific natural hazard (e.g., coastal flood, heatwaves, etc.). The CDSVi score can range 
between 0 and 100 with 0 being the lowest impact due to the combination of the three factors and 100 being the 
highest (Tedesco et al., 2024). The CDSV is also complemented by a Climate Displacement and Socio-Vulnerability 
Rank (CDSV_R) obtained by translating the numerical values into categories using k-means classification (Wu, 2012) 
and adopting the five different classes of Very Low, Low, Intermediate, High, and Very High (Tedesco et al., 2024). 
4.2.2 
Results 
Figure 8 shows the CDSV scores obtained  for coastal (a) and fluvial flooding (b) heatwaves (c) hurricanes (d) and 
winter weather over NYC (Tedesco et al., 2024). Figure 9 shows the relative contribution of socio-vulnerability (left 
column), displacement (middle column) and climate hazards (right column) to the CDSV in the case of the different 
climate hazards. Values can range between 0 and 1, with low values meaning that the particular factor under 
consideration weakly contributes to the CDSV and high values meaning that it is a dominant contributor. These 
figures illustrate, for example, a relative minor role over most of our study areas in the case of hurricanes (Figure 9 j, 
k, and l) where the socio-economic component plays a large role in south Staten Island and the Lower East Side of 
Manhattan. In contrast, in the case of heatwaves, all three factors tend to contribute to the computed CDSV in a more 
balanced way (Figure 9 g, h, and l), with displacement playing a negligible role in lower Manhattan and the climate 
factor playing a larger role in mid-Manhattan and, again, the southern portion of Staten Island. 
In order to better identify the location of the areas at highest risk of exposure to the combination of climate, 
displacement, and socio-vulnerability factors, Tedesco et al (Tedesco et al., 2024) ordered the top 10 CDSV values 
for the five hazards. The tract with the highest occurrences of top 10 CDSV values is located along Harlem River 
Drive, near the subway station on 155th street. The 2016 Census (American Community Survey) reports 7,601 
people for this tract with an unemployment rate of 27.7%, a poverty rate of 49.3 %, a per capita income (PCI) of 
$10,982. 34 % of the residents don't have a high school diploma, 30.2 % are younger than 17 years, 31.8 % are 
single parents and 99.8 % belong to a minority, with 85.3 % of the population not having a vehicle. As a comparison, 
the NYC average values for the same quantities are: 19.4 % (no high school diploma), 21.1 % (younger than 17 
years), 10.7 % (single parent), 67.4 % (minority) and 43.4 % (no vehicle).

The second-highest ranked tract is located in the Bronx, containing the 182-183rd street subway station and it is 
home to 4,142 people. The PCI is $11,675, and more than half of the population (52.4 %) live below the poverty line. 
Similar to the case of the Ralph J Rangel Houses, roughly 30 % of the population is younger than 17 years of age 
with 82.2 % not having access to a vehicle. Also, as in the previous case, 99.3 % of the population belongs to a 
minority, 91 % lives in multi-unit, and 31.9 % has limited English skills, with 39.2 % not having a high school diploma.  
A second tract ranked highly, according to CDSV top 10 values, is located in southeast Manhattan. This area is home 
to 10,765 people (according to the 2016 Census) of which 10.7 % are unemployed, 49.8 % have no high school 
diploma, 26.3 % are over 65 years of age, and 17.9 % are below 17 years of age. The PCI here is slightly higher than 
the other places, being $14,554 and with a percentage of 39.3% of the population who live below the poverty line. 
Similar to other areas ranking high in terms of combined top CDSV values overlapping from multiple hazards, 95.6 % 
of the population belongs to a minority, 81.2 % have no vehicle, and 43.8% speak limited English.  
The census tract located in south Brooklyn (also within the top CDSV score) contains 2,460 people. The relative 
percentage of people belonging to a minority is smaller than in the previous cases (43.9 %) with the percentage of 
people living below the poverty line down to 27.3 % and a PCI of $22,011, almost doubling the one found for other 
areas discussed above. Here, the percentage of people with disabilities is relatively high (34.9 %), and so is the 
percentage of people older than 65 years of age.  
The last tract where the CDSV has three top 10 values is located along Brighton Beach. This tract hosts 4,062 people 
with a PCI of $17,489, an unemployment rate of 15.7%, and a percentage of minority of 12.1%. Here, more than one 
third (37.2 %) of people are 65 years or older, and only 13.4% are younger than 17 years. The percentage of people 
with no high school diploma is relatively low (9.1%), but the percentage of people speaking limited English is 
relatively high (49.8%). 
Building on data provided by the NYC’s Mayor Office concerning changes in socio-economic and housing conditions 
for three different periods (2000, 2008-2012, and 2015-2019) (City of New York Department of City Planning & City of 
New York Housing Preservation and Development, 2023), Tedesco et al (Tedesco et al., 2024) additionally analyzed 
how such conditions have been changing for those areas where relatively high values of CDSV were obtained in 
order toto understand some of the socio-dynamic processes associated with or driving the combined risk of climate 
hazards and displacement and the populations at risk. To further this understanding, the study grouped the CDSV 
scores into 5 classes using a K-means based approach (Wu, 2012) and refer to the 5 classes as Very High, High, 
Intermediate, Low and Very Low.   
Focusing the attention on those areas classified as Very High and High, for example, the study identified  the 
following PUMA regions: # 3705 through #3710 in the South Bronx; # 4017 in South Brooklyn, # 4012 in Southeast 
Brooklyn, and # 4008 in Queens. The areas in the South Bronx showed a decrease in the Median Home Value 
between 2008-2012 and 2015-2019 up to more than 10 % (e.g., 3705 Figure 10) and a corresponding increase in 
rent of the same order of magnitude. These areas are characterized by a high percentage of Latin/Hispanic people 
(on average above 65 %). For the inland areas, the Latinx/Hispanics population has increased up to ~ 10 %, with the 
increase being smaller for the regions along shorelines (e.g., 3710). For some of the PUMA sectors, such as # 3706, 
the percentage of White people halved between 2000 and 2018 (from 11 % to 5.6 %) where for the PUMA # 3707 
and 3708 the percentage of African Americans has reduced by 6-8 %. The increase in rent and the decrease in home 
values point to an increased financial stress for the already vulnerable populations living there.

relative percentage of the population for the corresponding class with respect to the total population. 
The PUMA sector in South Brooklyn (4017) shows, differently from the South Bronx areas, an increase in both the 
median value and the rent. The median value increased by roughly 20 % between 2008-2012 and 2015-2019. The 
increase for rental was a similar order of magnitude. For the PUMA #4017, the Latinx/Hispanic population has 
doubled from ~ 8 % in 2000 % to 16 % in 2015-2019 of the total population, similarly to Asians, whose percentage 
increased from 23 % in 2000 to 43 % in 2015-2019. For the same region, the number of White people drastically 
reduced from 65 % of the population in 2000 to 36 % in 2015-2019.  
In the case of PUMA # 4008 the median home value did not considerably change between 2008-2012 and 2015 – 
2019, with a relatively small increase in the median home rent. In this area, the study noted an increase of the Asian 
population, which tripled in terms of the number of people and doubled in terms of percentage relative to the total 
population. Such increase is even more substantial for PUMA #4012, in Southeast Brooklyn, showing almost 
doubling of Asians (from ~ 30,000 to ~ 55,000) with a change in the relative percentage from 22 % to 36 %. 
Differently from PUMA #4008, however, the studied noted a substantial increase in the median home value by 27 % 
from the period 2008-2012 to the period 2015–2019.      
The study also  investigated the relationships between the CDSV and racial, ethnic, and health factors to study 
potential linkages that could provide suggestions for future policies or recommendations. These included health data 
(e.g., number of adults with asthma and diabetes) and racial/ethnicity data obtained from the recently released 
Climate and Economic Justice Screening tool (Executive Office of the President of the United States Council on 
Environmental Quality, 2023) and spatially co-registered with the CDSV scores at census tract level. In the case of 
riverine flooding, the study observed a systematic decrease of the median value of the percentage of White people as 
the CDSV score increases. This is accompanied by a significant increase of the percentage of Latin/Hispanic people 
and also Black people.  
In the case of heatwaves, the median value of the percentage of White people is minimum for low CDSV values, 
reaching a peak  in the case of CDSV binned values between 30 and 40 and dropping considerably after reaching a 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

 Interim Report for Public Release 
41 
CDSV value close to 0. In the case of Latin/Hispanic people, the computed median values begin to increase after the 
CDSV binned values of 30-40. An increase is also observed in the case of Black people for this hazard. 
Similar results were observed in the study for areas affected by hurricanes, winter weather, and heat wave outcomes 
showing the median value of the percentage of White people belonging to high CDSV values decreasing with CDSV 
scores and the percentage of Latin/Hispanic and Black people increasing, with the Latin/Hispanic people reaching the 
highest values.  
The study observed more generally that the relationship between CDSV and the median value of the percentage of 
people belonging to racial/ethnic classes are not statistically significant in the case of coastal flooding. This is also 
true in the case of White people and heat waves CDSV score. The remaining cases showed statistically significant 
associations between median values and binned CDSV score (either at 95% or 99 % level). It is important to note 
that Tedesco et al. (Tedesco et al., 2024) focus on exploring linear relationships between the values reported on the y 
axes and those on the x axes of the different panels. Exploring other non-linear formulas, such as quadratic or 
polynomial of higher grade, might unveil other relationships that cannot be discovered with the linear approach, 
though it would require a deeper understanding of the processes driving such relationships to avoid the risk of 
overfitting the model to achieve a higher correlation without considering causality.  
The percentage of White people exposed to CDSV riverine flooding and winter weather decreases, respectively, by 
1.3 % (riverine) and by 1.12 % (winter weather) per CDSV value.  The percentage of Black people increases with 
increasing CDSV values for all hazards but coastal flooding, with hurricanes showing the largest increase (1.35 
%/CDSV), followed by riverine flooding (0.52 %/CDSV) and winter weather (0.34 %/CDSV) and heatwaves (0.37 
%/CDSV). In the case of Latin/Hispanic people, the only negative trend (-0.92 %/CDSV) is found in the case of 
hurricanes. Trends are similar in the case of winter weather (0.99 %/CDSV) and heatwaves (0.84 %/CDSV), with a 
relatively lower value in the case of riverine flooding (0.66 %/CDSV).   
Finally, in view of the compounding effects of heatwaves and health (Madrigano et al., 2015), which can lead to 
deteriorating health conditions or premature mortality, the study also analyzed the relationships between the CDSV in 
the case of heat waves and the number of people diagnosed with asthma and with diabetes. In both cases, the study 
observed a strong relationship between the CDSV computed values and the median number of people diagnosed 
with the two illnesses. This points out the potential risks of compounding effects on health for those who already have 
such conditions in areas where the combination of climate, displacement, and socio-vulnerability is the highest. The 
correlation coefficients between CDSV Heatwaves and median values of people above 18 years of age with asthma 
and diabetes are R2 = 0.82 (asthma) and R2 = 0.92 (diabetes), both statistically significant at a 99% level (p<0.01). In 
the case of the two illnesses considered here, we find an increase of 97.1 (diabetes) and 56.5 (asthma) people per 
CDSV value. 
4.3 
Conclusion and Limitations 
As reported, Tedesco et al. (Tedesco et al., 2024)  developed a Climate, Displacement, and Socio-Vulnerability 
(CDSV) score for multiple climate hazards (coastal and fluvial flooding, heat waves, hurricanes, and winter weather) 
over NYC. Following Tedesco et al. (2022),  the researchers based the scores on publicly available datasets provided 
by FEMA, the NYC Dept. of City Planning, and the University of South Carolina. The score captures the relative 
contribution of climate hazards, displacement risk, and social vulnerability to the total score over the different areas of 
NYC and the ways that socio-economic and demographic conditions have changed starting in 2000 for those areas 
where the compounding effect of multiple risks and hazards is the highest. Such areas are located in the South 
Bronx, South Brooklyn, and Queens.  
The study also quantifies linkages between the CDSV scores for the different climate hazards and health as well as 
for racial/ethnic indicators. The results indicate that, except for the case of coastal flooding, the percentage of White 
people decreases as CDSV scores increase where the percentage of Black and Latin/Hispanic people increases, 
with the latter showing the strongest correlation. The results also show a statistically significant relationship between 
the median number of people with asthma and diabetes and the CDSV score in the case of heat waves. 
Given the results reported, the CDSV score might be used by the City to help inform decision-making about climate 
investments that account for both socio-economic vulnerability and displacement. It contains the potential to help 
guide where and how to target adaptation strategies and resilience investments to avoid or reduce the chance of 
maladaptation outcomes and climate gentrification (Tedesco et al., 2024). Importantly, the results demonstrate that 
the sensitivity of the population to the combination of climate hazards, displacement, and socio-vulnerability has been 
increasing over the past decades because of the evolution of socio-demographic factors and to the geographic 
regions where the combined effect is the highest.  There appears to be a strong correlation between people

42 
belonging to specific racial and ethnic groups and the combined effects of the three factors accounted for in the 
scores, highlighting the racial reverberations of climate change impacts on those groups who are already carrying the 
burden of social and racial segregation. This is also true for illnesses such as asthma and diabetes, reinforcing the 
inter-generational climate justice aspect of climate change, with areas where the combined impacts are greater being 
home to a high number of ill people.  
The proposed CDSV score and methodology, however, do contain limitations that can be addressed through further 
research. One limitation consists of the use of the specific datasets used in this study. First, as previously mentioned, 
the datasets used by FEMA to generate the NRI database are limited relative to what is known about some of the 
climate hazards, such as flooding, in NYC. The city can and should utilize climate data generated for this Report that 
is more specific regarding different types of flooding, for example, through the use of datasets at enhanced spatial 
resolution and accounting for local events that are missing from the NRI. This more granular data might improve the 
understanding of the spatio-temporal behavior of the CDSV.  Similar granularity for the socio-vulnerability dataset 
would be valuable as well, akin to the recommendations made in the NPCC3 report to utilize specific SOVI indicators 
to better assess neighborhood vulnerability in NYC. In this regard, a revised version of the FEMA NRI which now 
includes the SOVI dataset and an analysis of the CDSV values obtained using the two distinct socio-vulnerability 
datasets would be a useful exercise to understand the robustness of the results reported in Tedesco et al.(Tedesco et 
al., 2024) and here discussed. Similarly, one drawback of incorporating all 29 SOVI indicators with New York City’s 
displacement index is the likelihood of duplication in some of the vulnerability metrics. A more fine-tuned analysis, 
making use, for example, of Principal component Analysis (PCA) might reduce or eliminate the risk of duplication. 
Nevertheless, this is not straightforward as it is not clear how the socio-vulnerability terms are used by the City to 
generate the displacement index as we were not able to obtain such information.   Finally, the study authors note that 
the assessment of their results in terms of margins of error (MOE) was not performed given the absence of MOEs 
with the currently available FEMA NRI.  Although the FEMA NRI team is currently working to build this, and 
preliminary validation is underway using historical period, the authors note that the results reported in Tedesco et 
al.(Tedesco et al., 2024) might be relatively robust in terms of errors, given that most of the analysis is focused on the 
areas with the top CDSV values. 
5 Best Practices for Climate Adaptation Planning and 
Investment 
There are significant links between climate risks, adaptation investments, housing, socio-economic inequalities, and 
residential mobility (Section 4), that shape the equity outcomes of municipal resilience and recovery projects. Climate 
impacts and resiliency measures cannot be examined in isolation from other processes at play in a community. 
Because of this complexity, there is no singular approach to equitable climate resilience that is broadly applicable to 
NYC. Instead, diverse, multiple, and overlapping approaches must be developed with local input to adapt to the 
unique context of each community.  
In a review of the literature relating to equitable climate adaptation planning, two general themes emerge as central to 
achieving equitable climate adaptation: community-driven climate resilience planning and approaches should be 
prioritized over traditional top-down, government or private sector led initiatives (Binder & Greer, 2016; Shokry et al., 
2020). This sentiment was echoed in the interviews conducted with climate resiliency experts and city officials. 
Interviewees highlighted the importance of community engagement in every step of the process including the design 
of climate resiliency proposals.  In addition, since a major concern of climate resiliency initiatives is the risk of 
displacement, multiple studies highlight infrastructure investments, particularly affordable housing, as a necessary 
component of equitable resiliency efforts (Rice et al., 2019; Shokry et al., 2020, 2022).  
There is a diversity of innovative approaches to equitable and just climate resilience in NYC, throughout the region 
and globally. Since climate justice entails addressing intersecting systems that drive climate change and inequality, 
the responses must also reflect a depth and richness capable of attending to these multiple, interrelated systems. In 
addition to a review of the literature, this section is informed by insights from semi-structured interviews conducted 
with representatives from NYC-based environmental justice groups, including Sonal Jessel (Director of Policy) from 
WE ACT for Environmental Justice, Elizabeth Yeampierre (Executive Director) and John Fleming (Development 
Director/Project Manager) of UPROSE, Rami Dinnawi (Environmental Justice Campaign & Policy Manager) and 
Daniela Castillo (Program Manager, Green Light District) of El Puente, and Eddie Bautista (Executive Director) of 
NYC Environmental Justice Alliance. Many of the organizations and climate adaptation strategies that are described 
herein are also featured in the literature focused on case studies of just climate adaptation and resiliency planning. 
The following best practices can help guide climate adaptation planning and investment. The practices are designed 
to be illustrative, not prescriptive, enabling city governments, community groups, and other stakeholders to tailor them 
to their individual contexts.

Integrative Approaches to Climate Resilience 
5.1.1 
Seeking economic development opportunities that advance just transitions and adaptive 
economies 
Climate resilience comprises not only physical protection from climate risks but also social and economic resilience in 
the face of disruption. Adaptation planning and infrastructure investments can serve as opportunities to strengthen 
local economies, make them more inclusive, and promote regenerative industries. A just transition approach to 
climate adaptation considers the overlapping opportunities for wealth generation and promotion of health and well-
being, equitable access to renewable energy, and affordable, efficient homes (Sze & Yeampierre, 2017). One 
example of a just transition approach is the growing interest in “adaptation economies” sometimes also referred to as 
a green economy. Adaptation economies build on the need for adaptation investments, from workforce development 
to supply chain manufacturing, across multiple sectors and infrastructures. These investments can be leveraged by 
vulnerable communities to address legacy environmental and economic injustices as well as future climate risks. 
People United for Sustainable Housing (PUSH Buffalo), for example, is developing a 25-square block in Buffalo’s 
West Side, focused on green and affordable housing, vacant land use, and quality jobs to build a “resilient and 
regenerative community.” PUSH Buffalo created this Green Development Zone (GDZ) in 2008, and their 
neighborhood-scale work continues to enhance and preserve the community’s local economy in a self-sustaining 
way, demonstrating how short-term community development opportunities can create green sectors and workforces 
that thrive in the long term. PUSH prepares people to work with development partners and a network of local 
contractors, and they directly employ local workers through their related enterprises, PUSH Blue and PUSH Green. 
PUSH’s projects are designed to promote physical resilience–including green infrastructure installation, residential 
weatherization, and retrofits–while creating a thriving local economy (Hart & Magavern, 2017).  
Similarly, UPROSE’s Green Resilient Industrial District (GRID) Plan aims to invest in green industries and job training 
for low-income residents of Sunset Park, securing this economic base for a neighborhood that faces both climate and 
economic challenges (E. Yeampierre, personal communication, February 17, 2023). The GRID plan has already 
secured important public (i.e. NYC EDC) and private sector (i.e. Equinor) investments to implement economic 
revitalization programs tied to the port and job training tied to the offshore wind industry (Nguyen & Leichenko, 2022). 
Public and private investments coupled with community-based plans can produce multiple benefits for climate 
adaptation goals.  
Climate resilience investments can also bring new industries to environmental justice communities, with the potential 
to address legacy pollution while creating new economic opportunities (Shi, 2021). In NYC, the NYC-EJA and 
UPROSE are part of a coalition advocating for the city to replace nearby peaker plants with renewable energy battery 
storage facilities. NYC-EJA has also been in discussion with El Puente regarding peaker plant retirement strategies in 
their neighborhood and Brooklyn Community Board 1 (R. Dinnawai & D. Castillo, personal communication, June 14, 
2023). This could create jobs, but a community-led strategy is necessary to ensure that residents are able to benefit 
from the new industry and do not lose waterfront access in the process (Bautista, Hanhardt, et al., 2015). 
Internationally, the European Union’s “Clean Energy for All Europeans” package promotes renewable energy 
communities and citizen energy communities in part to address energy poverty and inequity (Directive (EU) 
2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Promotion of the Use of Energy from Renewable 
Sources, 2018; Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Common Rules for the 
Internal Market for Electricity, 2019). Within this enabling policy environment, cities and local institutions can advance 
decentralized energy models, helping to create not only local jobs but also new income sources for residents. The 
cities of Rome and Paris are both experimenting with programs to support solar communities and eco-districts 
(Government of the City of Rome, 2022). The city of London created a Community Energy fund to facilitate access to 
funding for creating renewable energy communities in vulnerable neighborhoods (Mayor of London & London 
Assembly, 2023).  
The United States has experimented with community solar, which has shown some of this potential but also raised 
questions around channeling benefits and opportunities to marginalized communities. The Institute for Local Self- 
Reliance's Community Power Map (2016) illustrates how much community solar efforts depend on a robust state 
and local policy enabling environment. 
NYC has some promising investments in solar that have produced economic, environmental, and public health 
benefits for vulnerable communities. For example, UPROSE partnered with the MTA to secure a 685-kilowatt 
cooperatively-owned solar project with 200 residents, and WeAct trained and hired 100 residents in the installation of 
415 KW of solar in public housing (E. Yeampierre, personal communication, February 17, 2023).

5.1.2 
Designing adaptation strategies to maximize co-benefits and address multiple challenges 
within a community 
Beyond economic development, adaptation planning has the potential to benefit communities more broadly. By 
intentionally harnessing planning processes and investments to advance what communities want and need climate 
adaptation can contribute to more livable places in a holistic way (Rudge, 2020). Adaptation strategies should 
address multiple challenges within a community, such as public health promotion, community infrastructure (e.g., 
parks and public spaces), and affordable housing. 
In Edgemere, Queens, the City’s 2017 Resilient Edgemere Community Plan (RECP) (City of New York Department 
of Housing Preservation and Development, 2017) aimed to leverage disaster recovery and other funding to make 
improvements to the neighborhood. The Plan incorporated a number of strategies for developing and managing new 
affordable housing, commercial/residential mixed-use, and open space in the neighborhood (City of New York 
Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2017). For example, the Plan incorporates a Community 
Land Trust (CLT) model for over 100 vacant lots owned by the City to support different land uses with the goal to 
“work with local organizations to develop a model for community ownership to facilitate long-term affordability and 
resilient land stewardship” (Change Capital Fund, 2023; City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and 
Development, 2021). 
Public health is often a primary co-benefit of climate adaptation. For example, WE ACT has created a 2022 Extreme 
Heat Policy Agenda to address extreme heat and its associated health risks (S. Jessel, personal communication, 
August 23, 2022).Whether addressing rising temperatures or any other climate risk, resilience policies are also public 
health policies.  
In addition, many green development projects can take on community uses, such as PUSH Buffalo converting 
vacant lots into community gardens and developing abandoned buildings into affordable housing and commercial 
spaces (Hart & Magavern, 2017). This work generates a wide range of benefits, such as vacancy reduction, home 
insulation, and improved food access, among others.  
Moreover, the benefits may be essential to placemaking and place-keeping, even when they are not measurable; for 
example, El Puente envisions using green infrastructure to create public spaces that can help root communities in 
the face of displacement pressures (R. Dinnawai & D. Castillo, personal communication, September 23, 2022). They 
apply four key principles in the review of green investments: (1) fosters community congregation, (2) reflective of 
community culture, (3) establishes a sense of connection to a place and its people (i.e. history), and (4) cultivates 
collective care in the maintenance of green spaces (R. Dinnawai & D. Castillo, personal communication, September 
23, 2022).  
5.2 
Community-Driven Planning Processes 
5.2.1 
Understanding the local context and history and the role of land-use patterns 
Understanding context and history is important not only to serve the community more effectively but also to make 
adaptation plans more successful in the face of intersecting housing and climate displacement risks. Without this 
background, planning processes risk perpetuating past harms and missing critical information. As Shokry et. al. 
(Shokry et al., 2020) explain, community-driven adaptation approaches “can be responsive in real time to social-
ecological processes and ensure that benefits belong to vulnerable residents.” 
In Edgemere, Queens, the City’s Resilient Edgemere Community Plan recognized the significant role of past racism 
and disinvestment in creating the conditions for social vulnerability, which sea-level rise now compounds. Similarly, El 
Puente has advocated for the closure of certain ramps on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) for adaptation 
initiatives, directly connecting the history of racist infrastructure development with resilience today (R. Dinnawai & D. 
Castillo, personal communication, September 23, 2022). 
However, history does not just help explain current challenges and conditions; it also points to community assets and 
strengths. For example, the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance (NYC-EJA) continues to advocate for 
the equitable preservation of “working waterfronts” in environmental justice communities (some of these working 
waterfront parcels are referred to in NYC as “Significant Maritime Industrial Areas” (or SMIAs)). While NYC-EJA has 
successfully championed better environmental and climate protections for SMIAs since the 1990s, they have also 
understood the critical need to retain “working” (or industrial) waterfronts for their significant potential as clean 
renewable energy hubs and other sustainable infrastructure investment options, climate adaptation opportunities and 
the presence of local economic development bases for adjacent underemployed Black and Brown local communities 
(Bautista et al., 2014). For example, while the majority of these SMIAs fall within floodplains, maintaining SMIA 
zoning while imbuing resiliency measures in these areas is key to protecting against climate risks like flooding while

45 
providing an economic base for local residents that helps also prevent future housing displacement. A good example 
of this approach is UPROSE’s Green Resilient Industrial District (GRID) Plan (UPROSE, 2023), which preserves the 
industrial nature of the waterfront--understanding the importance of this manufacturing history in shaping the future of 
green manufacturing–and how Sunset Park residents will be a part of it.  
Consideration of both past and future land use zoning and development patterns will be critical for ensuring new 
developments don’t further exacerbate inequalities as well as climate and displacement risks. Waterfront 
developments in places like Harlem, Sunset Park, Edgemere, and other EJ communities were identified as important 
sites for equitable climate adaptation and planning processes that consider the effects on housing as well as climate 
protections. For example, the Hazard Mitigation Zone, a zoning tool used by the City to restrict land parcels from 
future development, was implemented in the north side of Edgemere and coupled with the development of 
Community Land Trust (CLT) as a way to address affordable housing concerns (Change Capital Fund, 2023). But 
there are floodprone waterfronts throughout the city that are actively being developed for market-rate housing that 
can exacerbate displacement and flooding risks.  
5.2.2 
Going beyond community engagement: community-led processes 
Community members (including but not limited to residents) should have a direct, meaningful say in the decisions that 
affect them—from the start and on an ongoing basis in climate adaptation. 
In Edgemere, community engagement was a part of creating the Resilient Edgemere Community Plan (City of New 
York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2017). However, residents continued to voice concerns 
about the voluntary buyout program that the Plan recommends (Kensinger, 2017). In this case, the community 
developed its own vision for a just resiliency plan reflected in the report entitled “Community Visioning for Vacant 
Land Following Managed Retreat in Edgemere, Queens, N.Y.” (See RISE, (Seip, 2022)).  
Fortunately, alternatives to traditional engagement models are available, such as the community planning congresses 
that directly shaped Buffalo’s Green Development Zone. By centering community members’ voices, PUSH Buffalo 
was better able to identify development and environmental priorities that could respond to immediate challenges, 
increasing buy-in and making the Zone more successful (Hart & Magavern, 2017) even when this type of community-
driven planning was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
UPROSE adapted their climate justice organizing, experimenting with learning circles and social media to re-engage 
residents in efforts to strengthen social cohesion (E. Yeampierre, personal communication, February 17, 2023). This 
approach focuses on survival strategies, ancestral knowledge and community priorities such as renewable energy, 
clean water, food sovereignty, and wellness (E. Yeampierre, personal communication, February 17, 2023). No matter 
which engagement tools are used, the uptake of adaptation solutions depends on community buy-in, which starts with 
community-led decision-making (Rudge, 2020, 2021). 
5.3 
Collaborative Development of Goals, Programs, and Policies 
5.3.1 
Developing a shared vision with buy-in from government leaders and leveraged 
investments 
A shared vision helps community members, local groups, partners, and city governments efficiently work toward the 
shared climate adaptation goals. This buy-in also facilitates the flow of funding from governments to communities, 
and of essential information from communities to policymakers (Baptista, 2024). 
Several of the New York environmental justice groups profiled are part of coalitions with local and state policy 
agendas. By working collectively, these groups can build political will for climate solutions that invest in the most 
impacted communities. Their work has contributed to legislation such as the statewide Climate Leadership and 
Communities Protection Act (New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, 2019). 
One of the most powerful strategies that many EJ organizations employ for equitable climate adaptation is coupling 
policy advocacy with the implementation of climate adaptation measures and targeted investments in the most 
vulnerable communities. For example, groups like NYC-EJA and WE ACT supported the adoption of Local Law 97 
and focused on investments in job training and economic opportunities for vulnerable residents to help upgrade 
buildings as part of the implementation of this important climate mitigation policy (E. Bautista, personal 
communication, November 10, 2022; S. Jessel, personal communication, August 23, 2022).  
As a membership network, NYC-EJA helps to foster this cohesion by connecting environmental justice grassroots 
organizations in developing innovative environmental and climate solutions (New York City Environmental Justice 
Alliance website (New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, 2023). This was particularly critical when NYC-EJA 
created their New York City Climate Justice Agenda, an annual analysis of NYC climate policies and initiatives, 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

 Interim Report for Public Release 
46 
accompanied by grassroots solutions designed to reduce racial disparities and climate vulnerabilities. For 
partnerships and coalitions to effectively work together, communicating clear and aligned priorities can then inform 
higher-level agenda-setting for government agencies and legislation. 
PUSH Buffalo also leads policy advocacy, which has provided the insights necessary for New York State to create 
needed policies and programs: PUSH’s Green Development Zone principles have been codified in New York State’s 
Sustainable Neighborhoods Program; their planning conference helped lead to Green Jobs - Green New York 
(GJGNY); and, their campaigns have helped the state to develop new funding sources. All of these initiatives benefit 
cities beyond Buffalo as well, amplifying PUSH’s impact via the state government (Hart & Magavern, 2017; Push 
Buffalo, 2019). 
5.3.2 
Developing concrete anti-displacement measures that consider housing and economic 
conditions 
Resilience investments have the potential to intensify existing displacement pressures and create new ones. Several 
anti-displacement tools are available to both governments and local groups.  
One strategy is to create community land trusts (CLTs) that can provide a source of affordable housing for residents 
facing climate displacement. Edgemere is implementing a CLT as part of the Resilience Edgemere Community Plan 
(City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2017) and PUSH Buffalo landbanks 
properties they are not yet able to develop through the Buffalo Neighborhood Stabilization Corporation (A. Kim, 
2021). Zoning policy is another impactful lever. For example, UPROSE has advocated for maintaining Sunset Park’s 
industrial zoning because rezoning the area risks displacing current residents, as has happened in other NYC 
neighborhoods (E. Yeampierre, personal communication, February 17, 2023).  
WE ACT is also working on addressing cost-of-living pressures, such as campaigning to lower utility rates, make 
energy efficiency measures more accessible, and advocating for publicly owned and generated power. By reducing 
energy costs, residents are less likely to be displaced because of utility debt or the increased expenses associated 
with climate change, like air conditioning (S. Jessel, personal communication, August 23, 2022).

6 Conclusion and Opportunities for Future Research 
6.1 
Conclusion  
The City's climate-related equity work since 2019 has become more explicitly focused on redressing environmental 
injustice and racial disparities. This includes the adoption of various laws and policies, internal institutional reforms, 
and incorporation of equity into risk assessments and resilience planning.  There is, however, limited understanding 
of climate change impacts and adaptation needs at the community or neighborhood level and limited systematic data 
exists on city-sponsored adaptation projects and resilience investments. Going forward, the City's climate-related 
equity work would benefit from more comprehensive data on disaggregated climate risks at the local level and 
tracking of city-sponsored climate adaptation projects and resilience investments across communities. Climate 
adaptation and resilience planning should also consider the ways that climate change challenges that NYC faces are 
inextricably linked to the bioregion’s early history, and how climate risks for the most socially vulnerable populations 
are linked to both past and present land use decisions and their underlying inequities. Understanding the impacts of 
this history is vital for formulating just and effective policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  
Additionally, there are ongoing community-led climate adaptation and resilience initiatives that provide examples of 
how NYC can more equitably and justly incorporate local needs and solutions into climate adaptation strategies. 
These community-led efforts also reflect the desire for intersectional climate responses to multiple environmental and 
social vulnerabilities such as the need for affordable, safe housing, green jobs, and neighborhood stability.  Without 
the creation and implementation of climate policies and practices that promote racially equitable procedures and 
outcomes, the City will risk perpetuating inequities in new forms. For example, climate displacement is an important 
dimension of social vulnerability to climate change and should be measured by the City. The City's ability to measure 
the risks of climate displacement at an appropriate scale, such as at the neighborhood level, could help determine 
whether and how new climate-resilient infrastructure or infrastructure investments might risk displacement. Without 
anti-displacement strategies in place, resilience-promoting investments can have inequitable outcomes. These 
strategies most often require prioritizing community-driven climate resilience approaches that mitigate the risk of 
displacement. 
6.2 
  Opportunities for Future Research and Knowledge Gaps 
There are existing gaps in the state of knowledge related to the key themes covered in this chapter that are important 
to note for future research, broadly, as well as for consideration by the next NPCC panel. First, there is a dearth of 
comprehensive data related to the City's climate-related equity work that would benefit from tracking. This tracking 
could include equity metrics that help elucidate the relationship between vulnerability indicators and investments over 
time. There is also a need for more granular, neighborhood-level assessments of climate change impacts and 
adaptation needs along with the tracking of the performance of climate adaptation projects and investments. This 
type of systematic data on city-sponsored climate adaptation projects and other related climate investments, as well 
as more comprehensive tracking of progress on climate adaptation and disaggregated climate risk data, will help 
improve equity outcomes across multiple dimensions (i.e. contextual, distributive, procedural). 
Climate gentrification is a dynamic process that varies across contexts and hazards. There are myriad measures and 
indices of climate gentrification that emphasize different driving forces and use a variety of data sources. The 
empirical research related to climate gentrification processes is nascent and evolving. As new methods and data 
sources are developed, there will necessarily be refinements in our approaches and understanding of these complex 
systems. These methods will also benefit from more longitudinal and evaluative research that can better characterize, 
on a more granular level, climate gentrification processes in varying contexts. While this chapter puts forth the 
Climate, Displacement, and Socio-Vulnerability (CDSV) score for multiple climate hazards (coastal and fluvial 
flooding, heatwaves, hurricanes, and winter weather) in NYC, this approach may also be taken up in the next NPCC 
report to explore additional hazards, different socio-vulnerability data, and the use of machine learning tools to better 
capture potential linkages between climate, displacement and socio-vulnerability indicators. It will also be important to 
consider how at-risk communities and the City can access these tools and apply them to help prepare for and 
mitigate the impacts of climate gentrification processes. Finally, longitudinal, qualitative assessments of community-
based, justice-centered, climate resiliency planning and implementation can be used to inform NYC’s ongoing climate 
adaptation practices and investments. In particular, leading environmental and climate justice organizations in NYC 
can offer important insights and best practices for future progress.

Key Message 1  
The City's climate-related equity work since 2019 has become more explicitly focused on 
redressing environmental injustice and racial disparities. Over the past five years, the City has 
embarked on four interrelated sets of actions to foster and advance equity in its approach to 
climate adaptation: (1) adoption of multiple laws and programs to address equity issues related to 
climate change impacts; (2) internal institutional reforms in the provision of city services; (3) 
development of indicators and metrics and digital, interactive, and mapping platforms that are 
publicly accessible to track and monitor city agencies’ progress; and, (4) incorporating equity into 
ongoing climate risk assessments and in sustainability and resilience planning.    
Description of 
Evidence 
These findings are supported by a multifaceted assessment of the City’s progress on climate-related equity 
work. (1) Over the past decade, the City has adopted multiple laws and subsequent programmatic 
initiatives designed to incorporate environmental justice and equity into citywide planning and decision-
making processes. For instance, LLs 60 and 64 from 2017(Local Law 60, 2017; Local Law 64, 2017) 
established the EJAB and EJ IWG which are responsible for the EJNYC report, EJNYC Web-based Portal 
and Mapping Tool and the EJNYC plan; LL 78 of 2021 (Local Law 78, 2021, p. 78) resulted in the creation 
of the Equitable Development Data Explorer and a Displacement Risk Map along with a requirement of 
Racial Equity Report for certain land use actions; and LL 122 of 2021 (Local Law 122, 2021, p. 122) 
resulted in the creation of the AdaptNYC program, a citywide climate adaptation plan, and the Climate 
Strong Communities program.  
(2) The City has increased efforts to advance racial equity and social justice within city agencies. It joined 
the Government Alliance for Racial Equity (GARE) network and employed GARE’s Racial Equity 
Assessment tools to guide the development of racial equity policy and foster internal changes (Government 
Alliance on Race and Equity, 2023). Through Executive Order 45 (2019), the City created the EquityNYC 
program, designed to assess equity outcomes in the provision of city services and equity practices across 
city agencies (Executive Order 45, 2019). Integration of racial equity is observed in operational and 
planning efforts in other city agencies. Examples include the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s 
Race to Justice Action Kit, NYC Commission of Human Rights’ Anti-Black Racism Report, and the 
Department of City Planning’s Comprehensive Waterfront Plan (City of New York Commission on Human 
Rights, 2019; City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b; City of New York Department of Health 
and Mental Hygiene, 2023).  
(3) The City has multiple initiatives to identify indicators and metrics to track progress on equity and 
develop digital and interactive mapping platforms to foster transparency, and accountability. NYC 
Opportunity is leading the effort to identify and evaluate indicators and metrics on social and racial equity 
with initiatives include the social and equity indicators, poverty measures, and workforce metrics; these can 
be visualized on publicly accessible online platforms (City of New York Mayor’s Office for Economic 
Opportunity, 2023b; Poverty Measure - NYC Opportunity, n.d.; Social Indicators Report - NYC Opportunity, 
n.d.). With goals to communicate progress and promote community- and neighborhood-level planning, 
other city agencies have also developed mapping tools for visualizing data on population, land use and 
zoning, and environmental risks and vulnerability. Data sources for many of these tools are available for 
download on the NYC Open Data website (City of New York, 2022). In addition, more citywide policy and 
planning documents (e.g., NYC Hazard Mitigation Plan, NYC Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, AdaptNYC 
program) are made available online in digital and interactive formats designed to be changed and updated 
over time, functioning as “living” documents rather than static ones (City of New York Department of City

(4) The City continues to incorporate equity into ongoing climate risk assessments and sustainability and 
resilience planning. MOCEJ is currently sponsoring the Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation 
Analysis (VIA) study to develop a comprehensive assessment of future potential climatic conditions and 
associated impacts in NYC (McPhearson et al., 2024). The VIA research has the potential to advance 
equity by providing key information and tracking tools on most at-risk populations and can be used to 
inform the development of forward-looking adaptation strategies that prioritize vulnerable populations and 
EJ areas. Environmental justice and health equity are core components of the City’s latest sustainability

and resilience vision, PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). 
The plan contains multiple initiatives designed to increase resiliency and access to green and climate 
investments for vulnerable groups. Examples include the Climate Strong Communities program, 
FloodHelpNY and HomeFix programs, electrification and efficiency upgrades for NYCHA housing, and 
workforce development and training for green and circular economy sectors (City of New York Office of the 
Mayor, 2023b).  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
While there is strong evidence that NYC has made  progress in terms of integrating environmental justice 
and racial equity into its climate work, there are remaining uncertainties about the outcomes of climate-
related equity efforts. Considering that many of these initiatives have been recently proposed or are only 
now underway, it remains difficult to determine whether locally relevant adaptation needs (as well as other 
quality-of-life needs) are being addressed. Other uncertainties are about the effectiveness of climate 
investments in addressing the root causes of environmental and social inequities and building adaptive 
capacity in underserved and marginalized communities.  The data used to assess the City’s progress was 
largely based on a review of City-initiated reporting documents and a sampling of expert interviews. There 
is limited peer-reviewed literature and no systemic review of the treatment of equity across NYC agencies. 
Thus, the evidence is limited by the number of respondents interviewed and the author’s expert review of 
existing primary source documents from the City’s public records.  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the evidence base, there is high confidence that NYC’s climate-related equity work has advanced 
efforts to address environmental injustice and racial disparities.   
 
Key Message 2 
The City's climate-related equity work would benefit from more comprehensive data on 
disaggregated climate risks at the local level and tracking of city-sponsored climate adaptation 
projects and resilience investments. There are limited understanding of climate change impacts 
and adaptation needs at the community or neighborhood level and limited systematic data exists 
on city-sponsored adaptation projects and resilience investments. More disaggregated climate risk 
data and systematic tracking of city-sponsored climate investments are needed. 
Description of 
Evidence 
These findings are supported by the author’s expert review and assessment of the City’s efforts to 
characterize climate risks and adaptation needs at the community and neighborhood levels and to 
communicate progress on climate adaptation and resilience projects. While there are 59 community 
districts and numerous neighborhoods in New York, current evidence suggests that the City has only a few 
city-sponsored place-based or community-based adaptation plans. Examples include the Resilient 
Neighborhoods Studies, the Lower Coastal Manhattan Coastal Resilience Project, the Cool Neighborhoods 
NYC program, and the Resilience Edgemere Community Plan (City of New York Department of Housing 
Preservation and Development, 2017; City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2017; Lower 
Manhattan Coastal Resiliency (LMCR), n.d.; Resilient Neighborhoods, n.d.).   
While City has spent 73 percent of the $15 billion of federal appropriated rebuilding and recovery grants (as 
of June 2022), evidence suggests that current efforts to track and communicate climate adaptation projects 
and resilience investments do not provide a complete picture of the City’s spending progress and the status 
of completed and planned projects (Yeung & Levers, 2022). For example, the Sandy Funding Tracker lacks 
detailed information about the status or anticipated completion dates of federally funded adaptation and 
resilience projects and City’s capital contribution to these projects (City of New York Office of Emergency 
Management, 2023b). On the other hand, while the NYC Mitigation Actions Map conveys the status and 
location of the City’s capital investments in hazard mitigation projects, without comprehensive community-
based adaptation plans and strategies for each of the 59 community districts and/or neighborhoods, it 
remains difficult to determine whether local adaptation needs are identified and/or addressed (CRA 
Dashboard – NYC Hazard Mitigation, n.d.).  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
With regard to characterizing climate risks and adaptation needs for communities and neighborhoods, the 
City has recently developed multiple initiatives designed to address this issue including the AdaptNYC 
program, the Climate Strong Communities program, and the Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation 
Analysis (VIA) study (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022a, 2022b; 
McPhearson et al., 2024). Uncertainties are related to engagement and coordination with local 
stakeholders, integration of local knowledge, and how climate interventions and investments reflect local 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
51 
planning goals, visions, and desires. There is currently little or no independent peer-reviewed literature 
assessing this topic comprehensively across the City.  
With regard to the systematic tracking of the City’s adaptation projects and resilience investments, the New 
York City Office of the Comptroller has recommended that the City develop a Capital Project Tracker which 
provides detailed information about neighborhood-level projects (Yeung & Levers, 2022). The City, in 
response, implemented the NYC Capital Projects Dashboard in 2023 (City of New York Mayor’s Office of 
Operations, 2024). Furthermore, the City is currently implementing an initiative called climate budgeting, 
which can potentially enable transparent tracking of capital funding for sustainability and resiliency 
initiatives pursued by city agencies (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). Given that the City is 
releasing its first Climate Budget in April 2024, it remains to be seen how exactly this process will evolve. 
Lastly, the City is counting on new federal and state funding streams to implement current unfunded 
planned and proposed projects (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b). There are uncertainties 
regarding whether the City will be able to acquire sufficient state and federal funding necessary to complete 
these projects as well as how it plans to allocate and track the spending of the funds.  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the evidence base, and author’s expert review of the City’s reporting to date, there is high confidence 
that the City’s climate-related equity work would benefit from more comprehensive data on disaggregated 
climate risks and adaptation needs at the local level and from systematic tracking of city-sponsored climate 
adaptation projects and resilience investments. 
 
Key Message 3 
Some of the city's most vulnerable communities have evolved their approaches to combat a variety 
of environmental, climate, and social stressors.  The organizations profiled in NPCC3's equity 
section report that they are implementing dynamic approaches to address the various risks they 
face while providing multiple benefits to their communities. These benefits include expanding 
access to solar energy and providing upgrades for cooling residences experiencing high heat and 
air pollution exposure.   
Description of 
Evidence 
Three of the four organizations profiled in the equity chapter of the last NPCC3 report (Foster et al., 2019) 
were interviewed for updates to their climate adaptation initiatives. The author relied on public 
documentation online for the organization not interviewed. These organizations are located in areas 
mapped as most socially vulnerable to climate risks, as indicated by the SOVI index and similar indices. We 
followed up with these same organizations to determine their progress and evolution in addressing the 
multiple and intersecting climate, social, and economic stressors they face. Evidence was obtained directly 
from semi-structured interviews with implementing organizations and documentation, such as reports, 
retrieved from organizational websites.  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
The assessment of progress to date and implementation was based on primary data sourced from semi-
structured interviews with organizations and a review of publicly accessible reports. There is no peer-
reviewed literature that has assessed this implementation process. Also, one organization was not reached 
directly, thus the full extent of their climate adaptation work may not be fully reflected in this report. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is a High confidence level that the reported updates and approaches to climate adaptation by NYC 
based environmental justice organizations have produced multiple benefits for respective environmental 
justice communities based on the author’s review of primary source data and organizational reports. 
 
Key Message 4 
The climate change challenges that NYC faces are inextricably linked to the bioregion’s early 
history, including slavery and land dispossession. Understanding the impacts of this history is vital 
for formulating effective policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. An 
appreciation of the historical legacy of climate impacts on the region, and on certain communities, 
also necessitates a commitment to reparations and restorative justice. By recognizing Indigenous 
knowledge, seeking restorative justice, and reconceptualizing our relationship to land, the City can 
forge a future that respects the environment, promotes social justice, and ensures the well-being of 
all communities. 
Description of 
Evidence 
Cronon (Cronon, 2003) firmly established the relationship between colonial impacts on the ecology of New 
England and opened the examination of colonialism and environmental history. Wolfe (Wolfe, 2006) 
initiated the working historical theory of “settler colonialism” and Kauanui (Kauanui, 2016) discusses the 
ramifying impacts of this framework for interdisciplinary and Indigenous scholarship. Lipman (Lipman,

2016) (2016) like Cronon examines the ways in which Coast Algonquian communities tended the 
“saltwater” estuaries that also became a colonial contact zone in the Long Island sound region. The Public 
History Project (PHP) is researching the interlinkage between Dutch and English trade and settler colonists 
engaged in dispossession, enslavement, massive extraction, and Atlantic World trade. This short historical 
section derives from this PHP research project. Perhaps most significant for the NPCC, the IPCC has 
regularly cited Indigenous Knowledge and Traditional Ecological and Environmental Knowledge as 
important knowledge that need to be enlisted in addressing climate crisis. 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
The study of landscape ecology, Indigenous studies, enslavement studies, extractivism, and trade is a 
growing field of study and archives building. The evidence of each of these study areas has been well 
established, but the intersections of once-siloed areas of specialization are currently being explored by 
scholars in a variety of academic fields, including anti- and decolonial studies, Indigenous Studies, and 
African American/diasporic studies. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the  evidence from the historical record, peer-reviewed literature across multiple disciplines (i.e. 
decolonial studies, indigenous studies, anthropology, history, etc.) and the expert review of the author, 
there is high confidence that a systemic understanding of the history of NYC’s development dating from 
pre-colonial records to the present, are relevant to the understanding of climate injustices.  
 
 
 
Key Message 5 
Climate risks for the most socially vulnerable populations are linked to both past and present land 
use decisions and patterns and their underlying inequities. Although the relationships between 
historical land use and climate risk are complex and context-dependent, they often have similar 
underlying mechanisms such as past discriminatory land use and siting decisions, redlining and 
disinvestment, and lower land costs in hazard-prone areas. Many of these land use issues—past 
and present—reinforce one another and create future risks and vulnerabilities. Without intentional, 
anti-racist work toward climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience, NYC will risk perpetuating 
these inequities in new forms. 
Description of 
Evidence 
These findings are based on a growing body of literature that connects past and present land use to climate 
risks and social vulnerability today, with studies having the greatest focus on redlining (Hoffman et al., 
2020; Katz, 2021; Wilson, 2020). Other evidence comes from research on hazardous and industrial land 
use (Maantay, 2002; Marlow et al., 2022; Mizutani, 2018), housing and investment decisions (Buchanan et 
al., 2020; Lee & Jung, 2014), aspects of geography—such as elevation and waterfronts (Collins et al., 
2018; Keenan et al., 2018; Villareal, 2013) — and transportation planning and infrastructure (Faber, 2015; 
Hoffman et al., 2020).  
Academic studies also provide evidence on how land use issues contribute to future vulnerabilities, such as 
through disparities in buyouts (Elliott et al., 2020; Mach et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2022) and the inequitable 
distribution of investments in resilience and adaptation (Gould & Lewis, 2018; Hummel et al., 2021; Shokry 
et al., 2020).  
Research grounded in specific cities and communities, as well as news reports, demonstrate how local 
contexts and histories can moderate these general patterns (Campo-Flores & Kusisto, 2019; Lee & Jung, 
2014; Peacock et al., 2014). 
 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
There are relatively few studies that connect historical land use to climate risk in NYC specifically. Although 
studies from other locations suggest patterns that may appear in New York, contextual similarities and 
differences remain an important factor in determining how to interpret this evidence. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the evidence base, there is high confidence that historical and present land use contributes to 
climate risk for socially vulnerable groups, particularly through the legacy of redlining. There is also high 
confidence that land use and adaptation decisions today will continue to affect this landscape.

Key Message 6 
Climate displacement is an important dimension of social vulnerability to climate change and 
should be measured by the City. The City's ability to measure the risks of climate displacement at 
an appropriate scale, such as at the neighborhood level, could help determine whether and how 
new climate-resilient infrastructure or infrastructure investments might risk displacement and 
identify ways to mitigate that risk. A combined climate displacement and social vulnerability (CDSV) 
score is proposed to integrate socio-economic, climate risk, and evictions and housing data to 
better measure the risks of climate displacement at the census-tract level.   
Description of 
Evidence 
There is a developing literature on climate displacement or gentrification that has identified different 
“pathways” by which climate risks and impacts can operate to impact geographies and property markets 
(Keenan et al., 2018).  The literature identifies three types of climate displacement or gentrification: the 
superior investment pathway, the cost-burden pathway, and the resilience investment pathway. 
Increasingly, studies assess the resilience investment pathway (K. Best & Jouzi, 2022) and further 
complicate the other pathways by recognizing that climate displacement is a complicated and dynamic 
process (Black et al., 2013). There are now a number of case studies documenting these dynamics in cities 
such as Miami (Keenan et al., 2018; Li & Grant, 2022), New Orleans (Aune et al., 2020), Seattle (de Koning 
& Filatova, 2020; Rice et al., 2019), and Philadelphia (Shokry et al., 2022). Moreover, a number of 
researchers have created climate displacement and gentrification indices based on a mix of demographics, 
physical characteristics, climate risk and other factors (Aune et al., 2020; K. B. Best et al., 2023; Melix et 
al., 2023; Tedesco et al., 2022). Although the literature has demonstrated that there is context-specific 
climate displacement (out-migration of households) that is attributable to various social, environmental, and 
land use patterns, it is not clear whether gentrification (in-migration of high-income households) is a 
separate or intertwined phenomenon (S. K. Kim & Park, 2023). Existing research is illuminating but more 
research is required to understand larger-scale patterns of migration and the exact relationship between 
climate change and gentrification. Moreover, there has been no study of climate displacement or 
gentrification in NYC.   
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
NYC There are several metrics that are being or have been developed to account for socio-vulnerability 
and climate hazards. Nevertheless, only a few studies focus on displacement and, very importantly, on the 
compounding effects of the hazards. In this regard, the CDSV score for NYC referenced here (Tedesco et 
al., 2024) provides an opportunity and specific metric the City to assess the combined effects of climate, 
socio-vulnerability, and displacement and identify areas where early intervention might be necessary. 
Adopting or adapting the CDSV score referenced here is promising based on the reported results. 
However, limitations and uncertainties remain in the methodology. For example, the CDSV for NYC adopts 
a linear combination of the scores from the multiple climate hazards, which implicitly doesn’t account for 
non-linear effects (e.g., feedbacks among hazards) and doesn’t resolve potential double-counting issues. 
Moreover, information on the margins of error (MOE) is not always available and should be accounted for in 
the future as part of the assessment of the outputs.    
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the evidence base, there is very high confidence that climate displacement exists in a range of U.S. 
cities as a result of the interaction between climate risks, social vulnerability, and land-use patterns and 
dynamics.  There is  high confidence that climate is one driver of displacement risk, and that migration is 
responsive to climate risk.  There is also high confidence that the CDSV score referenced here can be 
adopted or adapted by the City to better understand the compounding effects of specific climate hazards, 
social vulnerability, and displacement.

Key Message 7 
Without anti-displacement strategies in place, resilience-promoting investments can have 
inequitable outcomes.  These strategies require several key approaches: (1) incorporating 
contextual equity and understanding the history of places down to the neighborhood level; (2) 
taking a holistic approach to reducing racialized vulnerability to climate shocks, including 
inseparable issues like housing and transit access; and, (3) recognizing that the cost burdens of 
climate adaptation (e.g., higher energy costs, insurance premiums, relocation) affect people 
differently—particularly when considered in light of homeownership and wealth gaps—and can 
result in increased displacement risks.   
Description of 
Evidence 
Researchers have found significant links between climate risks, adaptation investments, housing, socio-
economic inequalities, and residential migration and displacement (Rice et al., 2020; Shokry et al., 2020, 
2022).  Taken as a whole, the studies conducted on climate displacement and gentrification are now able to 
identify with more specificity how climate impacts and adaptative measures may contribute to changes in 
community characteristics and potential displacement of vulnerable residents in specific geographies (K. 
Best & Jouzi, 2022). These studies suggest that adaptative measures and resilience-promoting 
investments should account for the relationships identified in those studies to reduce the risk of displacing 
the most vulnerable and marginalized communities. 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
The relationships between displacement and resilience-promoting investments, energy and other cost 
burdens, are still being investigated. There are an increasing number of studies investigating these 
relationships in specific places and geographies. No such study has been conducted in or for NYC. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is very high confidence that resilience-promoting investments can increase the risk of displacement 
in socially and economically vulnerable and marginalized communities. There is high confidence that 
providing affordable housing and reducing the costs burdens of climate adaptation can benefit these 
communities.  
 
 
Key Message 8 
Key to achieving equitable climate adaptation is to prioritize community-driven climate resilience 
approaches. As an example of successful approaches, community-based organizations featured in 
NPCC3 have implemented climate adaptation initiatives that were attentive to the intersecting 
nature of climate risks and other health vulnerabilities, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These 
initiatives include climate mitigation strategies and provide multiple benefits including equitable 
access to renewable energy, affordable and efficient housing, and economic development 
strategies that promote equitable green, adaptation economies.   
Description of 
Evidence 
There is growing and significant literature on community-driven climate resilience planning that finds the 
results of that planning are perceived to be, or are, fairer and more procedurally just than  top-down, 
government or private sector led initiatives (Binder & Greer, 2016; Shokry et al., 2020). The findings of 
these studies were echoed in our interviews conducted with climate resiliency experts, city officials, and 
community-based organizations via semi-structured interviews as well as online website content review.  In 
addition, previous case studies of NYC communities also document how community-driven climate 
planning seeks to address the multiple and intersecting risks that the most vulnerable and at-risk 
communities experience (Foster et al., 2019). There is also evidence in the peer reviewed literature that 
features the work of some of these NYC based environmental justice organizations as innovative and 
reflective of intersectional, climate justice approaches, including:  Sze & Yeampierre (Sze & Yeampierre, 
2017),  Bautista, Osorio & Dwyer (Bautista, Osorio, et al., 2015), Nguyen & Leichenko (Nguyen & 
Leichenko, 2022), Rudge (Rudge, 2020, 2021), Bautista, Hanhardt, Osorio, & Dwyer (Bautista, Hanhardt, 
et al., 2015), Shi (Shi, 2021), and Baptista, Matsuoka, & Raphael (Baptista, 2024). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
There is a diversity of innovative approaches to equitable and just climate adaptation and resiliency 
planning and practices.  No one approach is broadly applicable to every NYC community. However, each 
organization described new approaches to addressing intersecting climate, environmental, health, 
displacement, and other risks even while many of the impacts of their initiatives are still in the 
implementation or planning phases.  There are uncertainties about how some of these initiatives will be 
implemented and whether additional lessons will be learned from long-term adaptation strategies. 
Longitudinal, qualitative research is needed to more fully understand these approaches and their 
applicability across contexts.

 Interim Report for Public Release 
55 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is very high confidence that the community-driven approaches to resilience and adaptation planning 
reflected in the efforts of the four NYC based environmental justice organizations interviewed are perceived 
to be more just and   contribute to procedural equity overall. There is high confidence that some of these 
approaches  have successfully been put into practice and are viewed as leading strategies as evidenced by 
both primary source reporting and the peer-reviewed literature.  
 
Key Message 9 
Best practices from around NYC and the world highlight the importance of integrated, affirmatively 
anti-racist, equitable, and just approaches to tackling climate risks. The three broad categories of 
best practices identified for more equitable and racially just climate adaptation approaches are: (1) 
integrative approaches to climate resilience that seek out opportunities to advance just transitions 
and adaptive economies; (2) community-centered planning processes that make adaptation plans 
more successful in the face of intersecting housing and climate displacement risks; and, (3) 
collaborative development of goals, programs, policies by leveraging relationships between 
communities, civic organizations, and state and local government offices and programs. 
  
 
Description of 
Evidence 
The ways that different communities, including local governments, respond to climate change and how they 
incorporate contextual and procedural equity is a rapidly growing field of research. Much of this research 
revolves around case studies.  This workgroup reviewed the literature but sought to identify adaptation and 
mitigation practices in communities facing the multiple and intersecting risks identified by some of the most 
vulnerable NYC communities (Foster et al., 2019). We conducted semi-structured interviews with 
representatives from local environmental and climate justice identified community-based groups. We 
examined local case studies representing the City’s efforts to engage in planning that reflected integrative 
and community-centered planning processes. We also identified practices outside of New York that were 
community-driven and addressed the multiple and intersecting risks facing these communities. 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
There are uncertainties regarding best practices for incorporating justice into a city’s adaptation and 
mitigation policies, plans, and actions. These uncertainties exist because of the need to adapt practices 
successfully employed in one place to another context. As such, just approaches should seek to 
understand and incorporate local knowledge and context. The uncertainties that exist are therefore 
uncertainties with regard to the application of specific practices in specific contexts. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is a High confidence level that the featured best practices reflect the importance of just climate 
adaptation approaches to address climate risks. This assessment is based on the author’s expert review of 
a broad cross section of peer-reviewed literature on just climate adaptation approaches that are relevant for 
NYC’s context.  
 
8 Sustained Assessment 
Climate justice requires careful attention to the intersecting impacts of climate change, social vulnerability, legacy 
pollution, as well as housing, energy, and health burdens. Sustained assessments of equitable and racially just 
climate adaptation strategies should include mechanisms for deepening community engagement to gather more 
granular data about climate risks that are emerging or exacerbated over time. Increased community partnerships can 
also help track the implementation of climate adaptation strategies and report on their potential to address multiple, 
intersecting forms of climate risks. Many community-based environmental justice organizations have experience with 
emergency response and adaptation needs and risks. They may also have community-based plans and initiatives for 
equitable climate adaptation that can be leveraged with City agencies to produce multiple benefits (Maantay & 
Maroko, 2009; Marlow et al., 2022; Mizutani, 2018).  
Sustained assessments can also build on the robust set of existing indicators and interactive data platforms for 
environmental justice (i.e. NYC EJ Web Portal), climate change (i.e. NYC Environmental and Health Data Portal, 
NYC Climate Dashboard), and housing displacement (i.e. Equitable Development Data Explorer) available in NYC. 
There is an opportunity to build on the CDV scoring approach developed in this assessment to track climate 
displacement over time in NYC. The use of multiple vulnerability indicators and mapping tools can help elucidate 
areas of overlapping climate risk where specific measures may be needed. The use of combined indicators of social 
vulnerability, housing displacement risk, and diverse climate risks requires updated, grounded data that can be 
reviewed by communities as well.

Future assessments can consider ways to collect and monitor the distributive, procedural, and context-related equity 
dimensions of climate-related investments. For example, future efforts are needed to compile a comprehensive set of 
climate adaptation investments across NYC, from multiple agencies and funding sources. There is also a need to 
monitor and evaluate the distribution and impacts of the various types of climate adaptation investments over time 
using an equity framework. There is an opportunity to leverage and build on NYC’s Environmental Justice Web Portal 
and Environmental Justice Plan, to incorporate climate displacement indicators and climate adaptation investment 
tracking systems. These ongoing, publicly available data sources can include community-sourced climate risk data, 
adaptation projects, and emerging needs over time (See Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice).

Abstract:  
This chapter of the New York City Panel on Climate Change 4 (NPCC4) report provides a comprehensive description 
of the different types of flood hazards (pluvial, fluvial, coastal, groundwater, and compound) facing New York City 
(NYC) and provides climatological context that can be utilized, along with climate change projections, to support flood 
risk management (FRM). Previous NPCC reports documented coastal flood hazards and presented trends in 
historical and future precipitation and sea level but did not comprehensively assess all the city’s flood hazards. 
Previous NPCC reports also discussed the implications of floods on infrastructure and the city’s residents but did not 
review the impacts of flooding on the city’s natural and nature-based systems (NNBS). This -- the NPCC’s first report 
focused exclusively on flooding – describes and profiles historical examples of each type of flood and summarizes 
previous and ongoing research regarding exposure, vulnerability, and risk management, including with NNBS and 
non-structural measures.

1 Chapter Summary 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive description of the different types of flood hazards (pluvial, 
fluvial, coastal, groundwater, and compound) facing NYC and to provide climatological context that can be utilized, 
along with climate change projections, to support flood risk management (FRM). Previous NPCC reports documented 
coastal flood hazards and presented trends in historical and future precipitation and sea level but did not 
comprehensively assess all the city’s flood hazards. Previous NPCC reports also discussed the implications of floods 
on infrastructure and the city’s residents but did not review the impacts of flooding on the city’s NNBS. This -- the 
NPCC’s first report focused exclusively on flooding – describes and profiles historical examples of each type of flood 
and summarizes previous and ongoing research regarding exposure, vulnerability, and risk management, including 
with NNBS and non-structural measures.  
Key Messages 
Key Message 1: NYC faces risks from four types of flood hazards: pluvial, fluvial, coastal, and groundwater, each 
with a unique geography of exposure that will expand in different ways in the future due to climate change.  
Identifying these four types as separate, but related, hazards is an important step in studying how they impact NYC, 
what FRM tools are available to address them, and where future research is needed. Climate adaptation planning 
must consider all four of these types of flood hazard and their potential impacts across a range of magnitudes, 
including very extreme events.  
Key Message 2: Discussions about flooding often focus on risks within the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) 
mapped by the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, the FEMA SFHA maps 
present fluvial and coastal flood hazards only. The recently released NYC Stormwater Flood Maps represent the 
city’s first attempt to map pluvial and some compound flood hazards, with risks spread out over a much larger 
fraction of NYC. In the coming year, the USGS and NYCDEP will be embarking on a study to investigate and model 
groundwater flooding in Queens and Staten Island. In this chapter, we present a preliminary assessment of pluvial

4 
and groundwater flood hazard exposure areas that can be utilized to support FRM. Additional research is necessary 
to develop hazard maps that represent a broader range of flooding hazards and their increase in magnitude in 
response to anthropogenic climate change. 
Key Message 3: Much of NYC is exposed to pluvial flooding, which occurs when the intensity of precipitation 
exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil and the hydraulic capacity of the sewer system. These conditions often 
occur during cloudbursts, short-duration periods of intense rainfall that can be embedded within large storm systems 
or occur as individual, hard-to-forecast thunderstorms. Intense rainfall has already been observed to have become 
more frequent in New York City since the mid-20th century and is projected to further intensify and occur more 
frequently with unmitigated climate change. Despite the increasing risk, pluvial flood hazards remain poorly 
understood.  The NYC Floodnet project is beginning to collect observations of flooding when it occurs, but more 
monitoring of rainfall, in-sewer flows, and flooding, along with Hydrologic and Hydraulic (H&H) modeling of pluvial 
flooding processes and impacts is needed.  
Key Message 4: In NYC, fluvial flood risks are spatially localized to areas of the Bronx and Staten Island where 
surface stream channels remain. In the remainder of the city, historical surface streams were filled and replaced, with 
their flow routed to the sewer system. As a result, fluvial flood hazard has largely been replaced by pluvial flood 
hazard in most of the city. Both fluvial and pluvial flood hazards will increase due to climate-change driven 
intensification of precipitation and elevation of sea level. While traditional floodplain management can be an effective 
strategy in reducing exposure to fluvial floods, a broader, watershed-scale approach that retains, detains, and 
redirects stormwater is needed to jointly manage pluvial and fluvial flood risks.  
Key Message 5: Current and future coastal flood risks are caused by high storm tides, rising sea levels, and 
historical development on landfill over tidal marshes and nearshore areas. In Jamaica Bay, tides and storm surges 
have also been significantly elevated by historical dredging and landfilling, worsening chronic and extreme flooding. 
For example, on December 23rd, 2022, a major flood event around Jamaica Bay was caused, in part, by dredging 
that has led to amplified storm tides which were nearly a foot higher there than elsewhere in the harbor. Further 
improvement of our understanding of future coastal flood hazard is possible through downscaling of climate model 
data and modeling of multiple compounding flood drivers. 
Key Message 6:  Many NYC neighborhoods have very shallow groundwater tables and already experience 
groundwater flooding. These areas include parts of the city that were developed when groundwater levels were 
substantially lower due to historical pumping of groundwater for municipal water supply. Groundwater flood risk has 
the potential to be particularly significant in NYC because of the prevalence of subterranean infrastructure. 
Groundwater flood hazards have not yet been assessed citywide, but preliminary efforts are underway. Sea level rise 
may cause groundwater levels to rise, resulting in inflow and infiltration of groundwater into sewer pipes and 
subterranean spaces and inundation of topographically vulnerable locations from below. Improved characterization 
of spatially heterogenous aquifer hydraulic properties and sustained monitoring of ground water levels will be 
necessary to develop projections for future groundwater flooding. 
Key Message 7: Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme precipitation events and elevating sea 
levels, increasing the likelihood of compounding either one of these flood drivers by the other. In addition, tropical 
and post-tropical cyclones (TCs) have caused severe storm surges and extreme rainfall to occur simultaneously. 
While assessment is limited by the small number of historical TC events, the limited evidence suggests that TCs can 
cause low-probability, dangerous compound flooding. Given the importance of TCs and limited historical data, a 
deeper understanding of compound flood hazard likely requires detailed modeling and downscaling to simulate such 
storms under the present and future climate. 
Key Message 8: NYC’s NNBS provide many valuable ecosystem services, including critical water regulation 
services that can play a role in FRM. However, many of these systems are themselves vulnerable to different flood 
hazards, especially along the coast. Research into how different types of NNBS are impacted by flood/storm surge 
events, hydroperiod changes, rising water tables and salinization is needed to better evaluate future changes in 
ecosystem services. Opportunities for designing NNBS to mitigate the impacts of various flood hazards need to be 
further explored.  
Key Message 9: Comprehensive FRM plans must be designed to address the full range of flood hazards faced by 
individual communities. Planning must begin with participatory decision-making processes that establish

5 
neighborhood-specific levels of acceptable future flood risk. To reduce risks from current levels, FRM tailored to each 
community will include combinations of structural and non-structural approaches, including NNBS, that are 
implemented in ways that reduce social vulnerability and are also synergistic with community histories, needs, and 
goals.  
2 Introduction 
 
2.1 
Chapter Scope and Context 
Located along the Atlantic coast with a year-round humid climate (Cui et al., 2021), NYC is subject to multiple types 
of flooding hazards (Figure 1). Even without climate change and independent of the significant anthropogenic 
morphological changes that have been made to the local geography, floods occur in this region due to extreme 
precipitation, coastal storm surges and high tides, high groundwater tables, and their co-occurrence (Figure 2). Over 
four centuries of urbanization, the city’s land surface, streams, wetlands, underwater habitats, coasts and soils have 
all been radically modified (Montalto & Steenhuis, 2004; P. M. Orton, Sanderson, et al., 2020; Sanderson & Brown, 
2007; Walsh & LaFleur, 1995). In addition, global climate change has elevated regional sea level, increasing the 
likelihood of coastal flooding (Braneon et al., 2024) and making it more difficult for sewers, rivers and streams to drain 
to the sea. In the absence of significant and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels will continue to 
rise and extreme precipitation events are projected to become more frequent, more intense, and possibly also larger 
in areal extent (Braneon et al., 2024; Fowler, Ali, Allan, Ban, Barbero, Berg, Blenkinsop, Cabi, Chan, Dale, et al., 
2021). Together these phenomena carry significant implications for future flood severity, frequency, and the 
resources needed to manage flood risks.  
Previous NPCC reports discussed some types of flooding, along with historical and projected changes in their 
occurrence due to climate change. For example, Gornitz et al, (2019) provided projections for future sea level rise, 
while Patrick et al., (2019) and P. Orton et al., (2015) mapped static and dynamic coastal flood risks, respectively. 
Orton et al.(2019a) updated the projections of storm-driven coastal flood risk considering monthly high tides and 
storm surge due to a broadened set of sea level rise projections and extreme wind. González et al., (2019) analyzed 
the climatology of heavy precipitation in NYC, including observed heavy rainfall days and trends in subdaily 
precipitation events at different durations, and their meteorological drivers, evaluated fluvial flooding in regional 
streams, and assessed the use of 311 to report street flooding. Zimmerman et al., (2019) described some of the 
potential impacts of flooding on critical infrastructure systems. While this body of knowledge is extensive, none of the 
prior NPCC reports comprehensively reviewed and/or mapped historical and future trends in all types of NYC flood 
hazards. 
This chapter broadens the prior NPCC-led discussion of climate change impacts on NYC flood risks. We review the 
current science on how climate change will impact different types of flood hazards and their associated risks on 
people and natural ecosystems. We also present an introduction to the key dimensions of flood risk management 
(FRM) including the use of structural and non-structural strategies and NNBS. The relationship of flooding to health is 
described in Matte et al.(2024), while the relationship to equity is covered in Foster et al., (2024). Future changes in 
population and transitions that may impact flood management are discussed in Balk et al., (2024).

3 Flood Risk 
3.1 
Flood Risk 
In undeveloped landscapes, flooding is a natural hydrologic process that plays an important role in the fate and 
transport of nutrients and sediment, geomorphological evolution, and the function of ecosystems (Benito & Hudson, 
2010; Junk et al., 1989; McClain et al., 2003). In heavily developed landscapes like NYC, flooding can have adverse 
consequences for both human and ecological systems. Floods occur because of dynamic interactions between 
human, natural, and atmospheric processes. Policies that determine how natural and engineered landscapes are 
managed; specify specific protocols for the planning, design, and management of infrastructure; and/or influence

Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
8 
certain types of human behavior can all significantly influence the occurrence of flooding and associated risks (Rainey 
et al., 2021).  
A key climate change impact, flood risk is determined by four factors (Crichton, 1999; IPCC, 2023a). 
1. 
The magnitude and frequency of flooding hazards, 
2. 
The exposure of people, real property, natural ecosystems, and critical infrastructure to inundation when 
flooding occurs, 
3. 
A variety of social, ecological, technological and infrastructure factors (Kim et al., 2022) that contribute to 
vulnerability to flooding, and 
4. 
The responses that have been taken to mitigate flooding (e.g. adaptation/transformation responses), as 
well as any tradeoffs and/or unintended consequences of those responses or any other actions taken to 
address other societal needs that make flooding worse, commonly referred to as maladaptation. 
Flooding creates risks when vulnerable people or ecosystems are exposed to flood hazards. Within cities, flood 
impacts can occur anywhere, e.g. within coastal and riverine floodplains but also at interior locations due to small-
scale differences in topography, drainage system constraints, and building design (National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine, 2019). Flood risks can also arise as unintended consequences of actions taken to 
address flooding or any other societal challenge (e.g. the construction of housing in flood hazard areas). Flood risk 
management (FRM) includes plans, actions, strategies, or policies taken to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of 
adverse potential consequences based on assessed or perceived risk (IPCC, 2023a). FRM can be accomplished by 
a variety of adaptation measures that may be implemented individually or in combination, by public and/or private 
entities from the Federal government down to individual landowners (IPCC, 2023b; Peck et al., 2022). Effective FRM 
requires equitable collaboration that is both vertical (e.g. across different governance levels) and horizontal (e.g. 
among various actors at any given level of governance), and must consider flooding’s physical, social, and 
informational dimensions (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019).  
3.2 
Flood Hazard 
Each of the four principal types of flooding that impacts NYC (pluvial, fluvial, coastal, and groundwater) are triggered 
by a wide range of associated hazards. For example, coastal flooding can occur due to infrequently occurring, but 
powerful storm surges that cause deep inundation over one or two tidal cycles; frequently occurring but moderate 
‘sunny day’ high water that occurs during the highest astronomic tides each month; as well as by future sea level rise 
that will result in regular inundation of the lowest-lying areas of the city. Flood hazards can be amplified when they 
occur concurrently. This can include compound flooding (when coastal and rain-driven flooding occurs within the 
same event) or when multiple hazards with the same driver occur (such as the co-occurrence of pluvial and 
groundwater flooding, or pluvial and fluvial flooding, all of which are driven by precipitation). 
The magnitude of a flood hazard at any given location is primarily characterized by the maximum depth of water 
inundation (Scawthorn et al., 2006). However, other factors may also strongly contribute to the magnitude of hazard 
during a flood event (Hossain & Meng, 2020; Wing et al., 2020). These include: 
■ 
Fast-flowing water: The force associated with flowing water can generate life-threatening conditions, even 
when floodwaters are only a few inches deep. The force of flowing water can cause pedestrians to be knocked 
down (Martínez-Gomariz et al., 2016; Musolino et al., 2020), and vehicles to be floated (Martínez-Gomariz et 
al., 2018), and can generate hydrodynamic forces that can destroy solid walls and dislodge buildings (FEMA, 
2019). Fast flowing floodwaters can erode large volumes of soil and sand, undermining vegetation, bridge 
piers, sea walls and foundations. The transport and deposition of suspended sand and sediment, along with 
vehicles and other debris, can contribute to additional flood damages.  
■ 
Waves: Hydrodynamic forces caused by wave breaking, runup and slam can cause severe structural damage 
to buildings and other infrastructure located along the coast (FEMA, 2019; Hatzikyriakou & Lin, 2017). 
■ 
Flooding rise time: The time between the peak of a rain event that causes (pluvial and/or fluvial) flooding and 
the time of peak inundation (Gourley et al., 2013). Virtually all pluvial floods, and many fluvial floods in NYC 
are ‘flash’ floods, defined by the US National Weather Service (NWS) as events that have a rise time of less 
than 6 hours (Gourley et al., 2016). Fluvial floods along the Bronx River may have longer rise time due to the 
size of its watershed.

■ 
Inundation duration: Describes the length of time over which an area remains inundated. Along with direct 
increases in the length of time of disrupted transportation, transport and utilities service, porous building 
materials exposed to floodwaters for longer durations have a greater likelihood of mold growth and corrosion 
(Marvi, 2020). 
■ 
Water chemistry: Floodwaters can transport dissolved and suspended contaminants, including potentially 
toxic chemicals or pathogens. The risk of waterborne infectious disease from exposure to floodwaters that 
have passed through combined and separate sewers is much greater than that associated with surface runoff 
(de Man et al., 2014; M.-C. Ten Veldhuis et al., 2010). Corrosion from saline coastal and groundwater 
inundation can cause additional damage to infrastructure and utilities (Abdelhafez et al., 2022; Tansel & 
Zhang, 2022) and can impact the health of urban trees and other vegetation that is not salt tolerant (Hallett et 
al., 2018a; Sacatelli et al., 2023; Woods et al., 2020).  
■ 
Live electric current: Submerged power lines or other inundated electrical systems can create areas of 
electrified floodwaters or conditions that allow people to otherwise contact live electric current. Jonkman and 
Vriling (2008) estimated that 3% of global flooding deaths were caused by electrocution, as occurred in 
College Point, Queens in 2004 (See Table 2 below).  
As a rule, the magnitude of a potentially hazardous weather event is inversely related to its annual probability of 
occurrence (Marshak & Rauber, 2022).  As a result, the magnitude of floods and the weather events that drive them 
are often described by their return period (Equation 1), or the inverse of the probability that an event will occur in any 
given year: 
R  =  
1
P  
Equation 1: Return Period – where R = The Return Period (years), also known as the Annual Recurrence Interval (ARI); P = 
Probability of occurrence in any given year (# occurrences / # years analyzed), also known as the Annual Exceedance Probability 
(AEP) 
While the return period provides a convenient way to describe the probability of occurrence of a particular hazard, it 
can be easily misunderstood for several reasons. First, it does not provide information on the timing of actual events. 
For example, a 100-year precipitation event does not necessarily occur once every 100 years. Rather, this event has 
a 1% chance of occurrence every year on average and, statistically, can happen more than once in the same year or 
not happen for many hundreds of years. Second, precipitation events with the same return period can imply very 
different precipitation accumulations, (typically measured in inches), and intensities (typically measured in 
inches/hour). For example, in NYC a 100- year, 24-hour precipitation event implies the accumulation of almost three 
times the amount of precipitation as would be associated with a 100-year, 1-hour event. However, the 1-hour event is 
more than 8 times as intense. Third, climate change is altering both the mean and extreme values of climate 
variables like precipitation accumulations and sea level (Braneon et al., 2024), creating uncertainty in the estimation 
of the frequency with which a particular event occurs. 
For all the reasons discussed above, event return periods derived from retrospective analyses of historical climate 
data may be outdated and inadequate for use in designing FRM strategies. The return periods associated with certain 
flood hazards are expected to decrease with climate change through the 21st Century, as the climate system 
accelerates. The NYC Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA) will soon be releasing updated 
and forecasted future return periods for NYC precipitation. As such research evolves, effective communication 
between practitioners, scientists, and the public is necessary to avoid misinterpretation and misuse of return period 
terminology in FRM planning (Water Environment Federation, 2023).  
Despite their shortcomings, return periods are commonly associated with flood hazards, and they are used 
throughout this chapter. The reader is advised to treat these return periods with caution, and as a rule, to use the 
physical characteristics of the event (e.g. its duration, intensity, frequency, spatial extent, etc.) as a more precise 
descriptor of the flooding driver.  
3.3 
Flood Exposure 
Exposure describes “the presence (location) of people, livelihoods, environmental services and resources, 
infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places that could be adversely affected by physical events 
and which, thereby, are subject to potential future harm, loss, or damage” (IPCC, 2012). For any specific flood 
hazard, exposure is a descriptor of what areas were affected by the hazard and who and what is in the affected area.

Due to NYC’s density, critical infrastructure and thousands of people can be exposed to flooding, even when 
inundation is only limited to several city blocks.  
Potential exposure to different flood hazards is typically evaluated using flood hazard maps. Flood hazard maps 
present the area over which a specific flood hazard has a defined probability of occurring. The most well-known flood 
hazard maps are the SFHA developed by FEMA, which are widely used to support city flood management. The 
SFHA identifies geographic areas that have a 1% chance of coastal and fluvial flooding each year (100-year return 
period) with an inundation depth greater than 1 foot.  Additional mapped hazard areas provided by FEMA include 
areas within the SFHA that also experience waves of at least 3 feet in height above the base flood water level, and 
areas associated with the 0.2% (500-year storm surge or fluvial flood).  
The term ‘floodplain’ is commonly used to describe FEMA’s SFHA, but only a small fraction of NYC’s flood hazard 
areas are classically defined floodplains- e.g. relatively flat alluvial landforms adjacent to rivers that are formed by 
processes associated with periodic flooding of the river (Benito & Hudson, 2010; Wolman & Leopold, 1970). This 
distinction has important implications for understanding flooding processes, risk, and potential opportunities to 
enhance the resilience of areas of the city exposed to flooding. To avoid confusion, in this chapter we use the more 
physically representative term ‘SFHA’ to refer to coastal and riverine flood hazard areas identified by FEMA. 
When mapping flood risks, it is also important to be mindful of ‘what is being exposed to what’ (Carpenter et al., 
2001). Flood hazard maps only represent areal exposure to a specific flood hazard – for example, areas exceeding a 
specific depth of inundation associated with an event with a specific return period. Areas outside of this zone may still 
be highly exposed to flooding from a higher magnitude (e.g. higher return period) event or from other types of flood 
hazards. Within any flood hazard area there is often likely to be a spectrum of exposure – with different locations 
exposed to different water depths and/or different combinations of flood hazards.

The dense, highly built-up environment of NYC presents unique challenges for providing direct counts of exposed 
populations. The smallest spatial unit at which population density data is available is the census block, which in NYC 
can represent several thousand residents (Manson et al., 2021). But flood hazard areas are often discontinuous and 
small relative to the size of census blocks, with boundaries that do not spatially coincide with them. In addition, at any 
given location in NYC, populations are often distributed vertically, with relevance for the evaluation of flood exposure. 
While residents on higher floors may be exposed to significant indirect impacts from flooding (such as loss of utilities 
or isolation), their exposure is very different from populations in ground-level or subgrade residences that may be 
exposed directly to deep inundation. Dasymetric mapping techniques can be used to apportion census block 
populations to flood hazard areas. However, these techniques have not historically been used to represent the 
vertical distribution of populations. Three dimensional dasymetric mapping of urban populations have only been 
introduced recently (Maroko et al., 2019; Pérez-Morales et al., 2022) and, to date, this approach has not been applied 
in NYC. 
Throughout this chapter, maps depicting exposure of NYC’s buildings to the flood hazard areas listed in Table 1 are 
presented. Because the Flood Insurance Studies (FEMA, 2007, 2013) used to delineate FEMA’s SFHA in NYC do 
not consider pluvial or groundwater flooding, nor the impact of climate change on future flood exposure, this chapter 
utilizes the additional hazard layers listed in Error! Reference source not found.. Current and future pluvial flood 
hazard maps were developed by the City of New York. The US Geological Survey identified areas with shallow 
groundwater tables that are subject to future groundwater flooding. NPCC researchers developed maps of coastal 
hazards based on Mean Monthly High Water (MMHW) (P. Orton et al., 2019a). Spatial data on buildings and 
subgrade spaces were obtained from the publicly available New York City Building Footprints and MapPLUTO 
cadastral datasets (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2022; NYC OTI, 2023).  
3.4 
Flood Vulnerability 
The term ‘vulnerability’ is used broadly in a variety of fields, including natural hazards management and everyday 
language. In this chapter, we define vulnerability as ‘the propensity or predisposition’ (IPCC, 2022, 2023a) of an 
individual, community, or natural system to be adversely affected by a flood, referring specifically to their ‘capacity to 
anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the adverse effects of physical events‘ (IPCC, 2012). Flooding can 
cause many direct adverse effects in exposed communities, including loss of life (Table 2), injuries, and damage to 
property and utilities from inundation. It can also cause a variety of indirect adverse effects, including the disruption of 
transit and transportation, extended loss of electricity, heat, and other utility service, health impacts from mold or 
pathogen exposure, and stress, and can contribute to the involuntary displacement of individuals and communities 
(Ahern et al., 2005; Sampson et al., 2019; J. A. E. Ten Veldhuis, 2011; J. A. E. Ten Veldhuis & Clemens, 2010). 
Flooding can also disrupt, damage, or destroy NNBS, reducing their innate ability to provide urban ecosystems 
services, including those needed to buffer the impacts of climate extremes.  
3.4.1 
Vulnerability of human communities 
Past floods have incurred significant known economic costs, but the true total costs borne by vulnerable NYC 
residents remain unquantified. In NYC, Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy (2012) was estimated to have caused over $19 
billion dollars of damage to NYC including lost economic activity, with much of this damage attributed to storm surge 
flooding (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013).  In 2021, a cloudburst associated with the remnants of 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment

12 
Hurricane Ida (‘Ida-Remnants Cloudburst) triggered an estimate $900 million (FMEA IA-$158M, SBA -$123M, NFIP-
$28M, NYS-ONA-$1.5M, and CDBG-DR-$310M) in known damages (Personal Communication, NYC Office of 
Emergency Management (July 13, 2023). However, it is unlikely that such estimates include the total costs incurred 
by NYC residents. Nationally, existing flood data have been found inadequate in representing the magnitude of urban 
flooding impacts (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019). While typical flood damage 
estimates are based on flood insurance claims or financial assistance provided by FEMA or other federal agencies 
following a flooding disaster, most NYC residents, including many who live in areas highly exposed to flooding, do not 
have flood insurance. Additionally, the FEMA Individual Assistance Program may only cover a fraction of actual 
property damage costs and is only available during floods that are officially declared disasters by the President. Many 
impactful pluvial floods are highly localized and not declared disasters by FEMA (Lo, 2024), suggesting that the true 
total costs of flooding to residents of NYC could be substantially higher than published estimates.)

A combination of infrastructure and socioeconomic factors contribute to flood vulnerability (Zahran et al., 2008).To 
help to evaluate the vulnerability of NYC residents to flooding, a team of academic researchers, working in 
collaboration with experts from the NYC Interagency Climate Adaptation Task Force (ICAT), developed The New 
York City Flood Susceptibility to Harm and Recovery Index (FSHRI) (Figure 3) as part of the NYC Vulnerability, 
Impacts, and Adaptation (VIA) study. The FSHRI is an index of socioeconomic vulnerability (susceptibility to harm 
and capacity to cope and recover from flooding) based on social demographic indicators (Table 3) provided through 
the American Community Survey (ACS) at the census tract level. These indicators were selected based on empirical 
evidence in the social science literature on socio-economic parameters that are correlated with measures of flood 
outcomes (Madajewicz, 2020; Madajewicz & Coirolo, 2016; Rufat et al., 2015; Zahran et al., 2008). The outcomes 
considered in the empirical analyses include depth of water for exposure; loss of life or injury; amount of damage to a 
home, loss of employment, and/or loss of access to food or health care for susceptibility to damage; and cost of 
recovery and length of various aspects of recovery for capacity to recover. The FSHRI is part of a larger effort to 
develop NYC’s first Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI), which includes the FSHRI together with scenarios of exposure to 
different types of flooding. The FVIs are available on the NYC Mayor’s Office Environmental Justice Mapping tool 
(EJNYC Mapping Tool, n.d.).

Many features of the built environment contribute to, or reduce, vulnerability to flooding.  For example, compared to 
traditional structures, buildings that have ‘wet floodproofing’ (measures that allow water to safely enter the enclosed 
areas of a house) or ‘dry floodproofing’ (measures that make a structure watertight below the level that needs 
protection) may be much less vulnerable even if they are highly exposed (NYC Planning, 2020). The placement and 
design of critical utilities, such as electrical, mechanical, and HVAC systems, can also be a key determinant of 
vulnerability.  However, building-scale data on floodproofing and the elevation of critical utilities is not currently 
available. For this report we evaluate the exposure of two building typologies associated with both physical and 
socioeconomic buildings: 1-2 unit residential buildings with subgrade spaces (basements or cellars) and New York 
City Housing Authority (NYCHA) buildings. Residents of 1-2 unit residential buildings and residents of buildings with 
subgrade basements or cellars are more likely to experience costly and life-threatening flood damages than are 
residents of large multifamily buildings and buildings without inhabited subgrade space (City of New York Office of the 
Deputy Mayor for Administration, 2021; FEMA, 2019). For example, during the Ida-Remnants Cloudburst in 2021 
(see Section 4.2), Small (1-2 family) residential buildings were disproportionately impacted, comprising 75% of the 
damaged buildings, while only representing 52% of buildings citywide (NYC OMB, 2023).  Based on NFIP claims for 
Post Tropical Cyclone Sandy 2012, small residential buildings were also more likely to experience structural damage, 
particularly if built prior to modern flood resistant construction standards (NYC Planning, 2020). The presence of 
basements in older buildings can, themselves, contribute to structural damage during floods (FEMA, 2023a). In 
addition, basement apartments often provide a secondary source of income for small-residence property owners, who 
are often small landlords that live on-site. Basement apartments in these types of buildings disproportionately serve 
very low-income households, recent immigrants, and other socioeconomically vulnerable households that lack access 
to affordable options in the general housing market (NYC OMB, 2023). 
Over 400,000 New Yorkers live in NYCHA residences, which can include many multi-generational communities with 
internal support structures and kinship networks that can help to reduce vulnerability to flood hazards, especially 
when compared with communities that lack such social cohesion (Beck, 2019; Bixler et al., 2021; Keene & 
Geronimus, 2011; Usamah et al., 2014). At the same time, NYCHA residents often face distinct socioeconomic and 
infrastructure vulnerabilities – they are disproportionately elderly, disabled, and low-income, and from groups that are 
victims of racism and ethnic marginalization (Hernández et al., 2018). Also, while substantial progress has been 
made in floodproofing and structurally reinforcing NYCHA buildings located in the FEMA SFHA since Post-Tropical 
Storm Sandy in 2012 (New York City Housing Authority, 2021) and pilot cloudburst management strategies are 
planned for some NYCHA developments  (City of New York Office of Management and Budget, 2023; New York City 
Housing Authority, 2021), most NYCHA buildings outside the SFHA remain vulnerable to flooding.  These 
vulnerability factors are exacerbated by a legacy of multidecadal deferred maintenance in many NYCHA properties 
(La Mort, 2018).  
3.4.2 
Vulnerability of natural and nature-based systems 
NYC’s NNBS provide a wide range of regulating, provisioning, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services, to which 
many NYC residents attach significant value (Miller & Montalto, 2019). These include water regulating services that 
can help reduce the impacts of different types of floods, as described in detail in the recently published International 
Guidelines for Natural and Nature-based Features for Flood Risk Management (Bridges et al., 2021). But NNBS are 
also vulnerable to climate change since shifts in temperature, flood frequency, sediment and salt loading can all 
impact their function and ability to provide ecosystem services. 
For example, sea level rise and storm surges will raise coastal groundwater tables and cause saltwater to enter 
coastal aquifers (Nordio et al., 2023). Changes to soil salinity can trigger complex changes to vegetation composition, 
ultimately favoring salt-tolerant species (Woods et al., 2020). Though salt adversely affects trees at all stages of 
growth and development, responses vary significantly by species (Dmuchowski et al., 2022; Middleton, 2016; W. 
Wang et al., 2019). Exposed to salt water, some tree species may have difficulty germinating by seed (Kirwan et al., 
2007; Woods et al., 2020), while others may stop producing new leaves, senesce prematurely, fail to recruit new 
individuals, or die (Munns & Tester, 2008). Analyzing street trees in Post Tropical Cyclone Sandy’s inundation zone 
three years after the storm, Hallet et al. (2018b) found that red maple (Acer rubrum) was negatively impacted by 
saltwater flooding but was able to recover over time. London plane trees (Platanus x acerifolia), by contrast, showed 
high mortality and no signs of recovery. 
Tidal wetlands are particularly sensitive to changes in both mean sea level and tidal range. Tidal wetlands require 
regular cycles of surface flooding and exposure, as well as deeper and longer duration episodic flooding that typically 
occurs during spring tides and storm surges. Some storm events can supply a pulse of sediment that enables 
wetlands to keep pace with sea level rise and weather future storm events (Carey et al., 2017; Castagno et al., 2018; 
Orson et al., 1998; Yeates et al., 2020). In contrast, other large storms can produce high velocities and can deepen

15 
channels and tidal flats, propagating waves further into tidal creeks, causing scouring and long-term erosion, even 
during subsequent calm conditions (Hauser et al., 2015; Leonardi et al., 2018). 
The frequency of wetland inundation, also called its hydroperiod, is determined jointly by sea level and wetland 
elevation. Wetlands with hydroperiods that are extended due to sea level rise may undergo significant changes in 
structure and function (Fagherazzi et al., 2020; Montalto et al., 2006) that hinder their ability to provide ecosystem 
services such as water quality improvement, and wave attenuation, and can eventually lead to their loss (Valiela et 
al., 2023). In undeveloped landscapes, wetlands experiencing sea level rise migrate in a landward direction. 
However, in many parts of NYC, landward migration of tidal wetlands is impossible given the presence of engineered 
coastal infrastructure (e.g. highways, bulkheads, buildings, etc.) highlighting the importance of protecting existing and 
potential pathways (Calvin et al., 2018; Montalto & Steenhuis, 2004).  
Tidal wetlands can also be sensitive to a reduction in hydroperiod, for example if a tide gate, barrier or other hydraulic 
restriction prevents high tide flooding (Montalto & Steenhuis, 2004). Less frequent flooding often results in a reduction 
in sediment delivery to the wetland surface. Wetlands that are sediment starved need active management and 
restoration to persist in place. Jamaica Bay marshes, for example, are sediment poor (Chant et al., 2021; Peteet et 
al., 2018) and extremely high nutrient loading impacts their structural integrity and ability to grow vertically (Deegan et 
al., 2012; B. R. Rosenzweig, Groffman, et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2014; Wigand et al., 2014). Courtney et al (2023) 
found that over a recent 20-year period, high tides propagated further into the groundwater aquifer of a brackish 
Hudson River tidal wetland even though the marsh surface elevation was increasing at a rate that matched sea level 
rise. This phenomenon was attributed to high tides increasing faster than mean sea level. Such impacts are 
significant given the importance of NYC wetlands in sustaining biodiversity and many critical and endangered 
species. Without active management, such wetlands undergo significant ecological changes (Morris et al., 2020) as 
outlined in detail in the City’s Wetland Management Framework (Swadek et al., 2021).  
Outside NYC and along the Eastern Atlantic coast, sea level rise has also been linked to a reduction in the 
distributional area of lichens (Allen & Lendemer, 2016), a modification of the position of the marsh–forest interface 
(Kirwan et al., 2007), reductions in carbon sequestration, above- and below-ground carbon storage potential (Meixler 
et al., 2023), and long term reductions in the radial growth of a coastal pine forest years after coastal inundation 
(Fernandes et al., 2018). More research is needed to determine the vulnerability of other NNBS to various flood 
hazards in NYC. 
3.5 
Responses 
Flood risks are heavily influenced by the responses that are taken to reduce perceived flood hazards. If these 
responses result in successful adaptation or transformation, they can reduce flood risks. Responses that 
inadvertently increase risk or vulnerability to a hazard are referred to as maladaptive. In the flooding context, actions 
that transfer flood risks from one place to another, reduce flood preparedness, stimulate development in flood hazard 
areas, cause gentrification, or increase the vulnerability of NNBS can all be considered maladaptive. A thorough 
exploration of responses that increase and decrease flood risks is provided in Section 9 of this chapter.  
4 Pluvial Flooding 
4.1 
Pluvial Flood Hazard Characterization 
Pluvial flooding occurs when the intensity of precipitation and resulting stormwater runoff exceeds the capacity of the 
land surface to infiltrate it, and/or when the rate of excess precipitation exceeds the stormwater conveyance 
capacities of natural and engineered drainage systems, resulting in surface ponding (B. R. Rosenzweig, McPhillips, 
et al., 2018). This process dominates the hydrologic cycle of most densely developed cities, which typically have a 
high percentage of buildings, pavements and other impervious surfaces that inhibit stormwater infiltration. As a result, 
pluvial flooding is often referred to as ‘urban’ flooding (Agonafir et al., 2023).  
Although impervious surfaces are the primary contributor to pluvial flooding, this mechanism can also occur over 
pervious surfaces. When the intensity of short duration precipitation events, (commonly referred to as cloudbursts 1, 
exceeds the infiltration capacity of pervious surfaces, the excess precipitation will accumulate and flow over the 
surface. This phenomenon is more likely when pervious surfaces are already saturated, and/or are covered with 
snow or ice (Andradóttir et al., 2021; Moghadas et al., 2018). Alizadehtazi et al. (2016) found that the infiltration 
capacity of urban park soils, tree pits without tree guards, porous pavers, and certain bioretention facilities were 
frequently below the intensity of the intensity of the 5 yr, 6 minute design storm used to design many components of 
the city’s stormwater drainage systems, underscoring the potential of these pervious surfaces to produce runoff.

To reduce pluvial flooding, the city’s separate and combined sewer systems were designed to intercept and convey 
‘excess precipitation’ rapidly away from buildings and roads (Tarr, 2001). However, engineered drainage systems 
have a finite capacity, which is another key contributor to pluvial flood hazard. Three limitations of the sewer system 
that can contribute include: 1) the spacing and hydraulic capacity of different types of inlets, 2) hydraulic bottlenecks 
within the piped collection system, and 3) hydrologic overload. Each of these limitations is described in greater detail 
below.  
■ 
Inlet conditions: If stormwater is presented to sewer inlets at rates that exceed inlet hydraulic capacities, the 
excess runoff will bypass (even if the sewer pipes themselves are not full), causing pluvial flooding further 
down gradient. In general, grated inlets have higher hydraulic capacities than curb cuts, and curbcuts have 
greater hydraulic capacity if they are built with higher apron slopes and longer openings. Bypass can be 
exacerbated by adverse street slopes and/or if snow, leaves, litter, or other debris clogs stormwater inlets, 
reducing their interception capacities (Agonafir, Lakhankar, et al., 2022; Agonafir, Pabon, et al., 2022; 
Shevade et al., 2020; Shevade & Montalto, 2021). Bypass of inlets can also be triggered if there are blockages 
just downstream of the inlet, inhibiting free flow through them. The lack of an inlet can also trigger pluvial 
flooding if runoff accumulates in undrained topographic depressions.  
■ 
Hydraulic bottlenecks: Pluvial flooding can occur if the conveyance capacity of a particular segment of the 
engineered drainage system (e.g. a catch basin hood, a segment of pipe, a pump, etc.) is unable to convey 
stormwater through the system at the rate at which it is approaching that feature. Under these conditions, 
stormwater will back up within the pipes and can ultimately reach the surface through manholes and catch 
basins (known as a ‘surcharge’) and/or backup into low-lying buildings, subgrade spaces, and other 
topographically vulnerable areas.  
■ 
Hydrologic overload: During extreme precipitation events, some sewer pipes can become filled with water. 
Under these conditions, any additional rainfall, even at low intensities, will accumulate on the surface. The 
city’s combined sewer system, which serves about 60% of the city and conveys both stormwater and 
wastewater in the same pipe network, was also designed with relief points to reduce the chances of surcharge 
or backup events. Known as CSOs, these features of the combined sewer system release untreated combined 
sewage into the city’s surface water bodies, creating significant human and ecological health risks which could 
increase as climate change causes precipitation to increase. 
Cloudbursts are a particularly important driver of pluvial flooding (B. Rosenzweig et al., 2019). Recent research by the 
VIA team (McPhearson et al., 2024) suggests that many historical pluvial flood episodes were triggered by short-
duration (less than 6-hour) high intensity precipitation events. Cloudbursts may occur as highly localized, individual 
convective (thunderstorm) cells, or they can be embedded within larger storm systems, including tropical and post-
tropical storms, large frontal systems, and Nor’Easters. The intense rain associated with any particular cloudburst is 
usually limited to small areas of the city, but intense rain can also be widespread if thunderstorms are organized into 
mesoscale storm systems (Smith et al., 2023).   
The US National Weather Service provides Excessive Rainfall Outlook (ERO) forecasts, which can identify the large-
scale weather and hydrological conditions associated with cloudbursts and flash flooding up to 5 days in advance 
(Burke et al., 2023). These regional forecasts are further enhanced for NYC based on event-specific mesoscale 
meteorological conditions, but current science is not able to provide forecasts of the exact location, areal extent, 
intensity, and timing of cloudbursts (L. Speight & Krupska, 2021).  Advance warning of imminent potential flooding 
remains limited to radar-based observations of approaching extreme rainfall and in-situ observations of flooding that 
has already begun, with a nationwide average lead time of 61-68 minutes (Martinaitis et al., 2023). These forecasting 
challenges make emergency preparations and risk management for pluvial flooding particularly challenging.

Historical Example: Ida-Remnants Cloudburst Pluvial Flooding 
New York City experienced widespread, severe pluvial flooding during a cloudburst on September 1, 2021 (‘Ida-
Remnants Cloudburst’). Flooding from this event caused 12 drowning fatalities in NYC, which included 11 deaths in 
subgrade residences and offices. A 13th direct fatality resulted from asphyxiation when the victim’s flooded car 
caught fire. Figure 4 depicts flood related service requests during the event, along with the location of the residential 
drowning fatalities. As shown, many of these locations were far outside the most recently developed (Preliminary) 
SFHA (FEMA, 2013). Flooding from this event was also associated with extensive damage to property and critical 
infrastructure, displacement due to loss of living quarters, and major disruptions to transit and transportation networks 
(City of New York Office of Management and Budget, 2023; City of New York Office of the Deputy Mayor for 
Administration, 2021).

measurement intervals. For example, 3.76 inches of rain fell in the 60-minute period between 21:18 and 22:18 at LaGuardia Airport. 
Graphic by BR Rosenzweig. 
The extremely intense rainfall associated with this event resulted from three coinciding meteorological factors (Smith 
et al., 2023): 
■ 
The remnants of Hurricane Ida, which passed southwest of the city as a post-tropical surface low-pressure 
system, bringing deep tropical moisture. Precipitable water values peaked at 2.1-2.2 inches over the NYC 
metropolitan area during this event. 
■ 
A large, long-wave trough to the north of the city, which allowed a deep baroclinic wave to develop along the 
frontal boundary of the warm air mass associated with the approaching remnant low. This wave created 
instability and deep convection. 
■ 
A powerful, near-zonal jet streak at 250mb, centered over southeastern Canada. This placed NYC in the right 
rear entrance quadrant of the jet streak and beneath the area of high upper-level divergence. This upper-level 
divergence induced large-scale lift over the region, enhancing persistent, deep convection. 
The Ida-remnants cloudburst was remarkable not only for its extreme rainfall intensity, but also for the large area of 
the city impacted by it. Most of the city received precipitation quantities that exceeded  the 100-year 2 and 3-hour 
storm accumulations (Figure 5 and Figure 6). There was a sharp gradient in rainfall from west to east across the city, 
with far eastern parts of the city such as southeast Queens and the Rockaways receiving only moderate rainfall.    
While there are multiple mechanisms through which climate change can increase the intensity of cloudburst events in 
NYC, these processes remain poorly represented in global-scale numerical models used to develop climate 
projections (Fowler, Wasko, et al., 2021). At present, there is insufficient information to determine if, or to what extent, 
climate change contributed to the intensity, duration, or areal extent of the Ida-remnants cloudburst. Attribution 
studies focused on this, and similar events, are needed to determine the role that climate change may have had in 
setting it up and whether more events of similar intensity and spatial extent will occur in NYC in the future.

Exposure and Vulnerability to Pluvial Flooding 
4.3.1 
Pluvial flood hazard mapping  
In 2018, the NYC City Council passed Local Law 172 (Local Law 172, 2018), which required city agencies to develop 
maps to identify areas of the city that will be most exposed to flooding due to climate change. Because the FEMA’s 
SFHA maps do not include pluvial flood hazard areas, NYCDEP contracted with an academic and consultant team on 
a Stormwater Resiliency Study (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021), which became the first effort to 
map pluvial flood hazards in NYC.  
Since pluvial flooding is caused by hydrologic processes that create runoff (e.g. precipitation excess) volumes that 
can exceed the limited hydraulic capacity of various components of the surface (e.g. channels, gutters, inlets) and 
subsurface (e.g. pipes, pumps, weirs) collection systems, mapping pluvial flood hazards requires the use of numerical 
models that can represent these complex and coupled processes at high spatial and temporal resolution (B. R. 
Rosenzweig et al., 2021). The Stormwater Resiliency Study involved the development of 13 Hydraulic and Hydrologic 
(H&H) models using Innovyze’s InfoWorks ICM software (AutoDesk, 2023), each representing a major sewershed 
that drains into one of NYC’s wastewater treatment plants. As detailed in the Stormwater Resiliency Plan (City of New 
York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021), these models utilized a 1D-2D modeling approach. This coupled form of 
modeling is a recent advance and requires significant computing power and detailed topographic information. Some 
areas of the city, including large (>100,000 ft2) parks, large (>250,000 ft2) non-residential and non-commercial private 
lots, and any lots that intersect railway infrastructure were excluded from the resulting pluvial flood hazard maps due 
to a lack of information regarding their drainage system design (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021).  
The Stormwater Resiliency Study models were used to simulate flooding associated with the following three 
scenarios: 
■ 
Moderate Stormwater Flood without Sea Level Rise:  ~2 inches of rainfall falling uniformly across the city in 
one hour. 
■ 
Moderate Stormwater Flood with 2050’s Sea Level Rise:  ~2 inches of rainfall falling uniformly across the 
city in one hour, co-occurring with coastal water levels elevated by 30 inches. 
■ 
Extreme Stormwater Flood with 2080’s Sea Level Rise: ~3.5 inches of rainfall, falling uniformly across the 
city in one hour, co-occurring with coastal water levels elevated by 58 inches. 
Each of these scenarios was simulated individually, as a singular event, without consideration of antecedent moisture 
conditions. Buildings were represented as obstructions. We utilize two of these three scenarios (Moderate 
Stormwater Flood without SLR and Extreme Stormwater Flood with 2080s SLR) in this report (Table 1).  
To evaluate present day pluvial flood exposure, we use the Moderate Scenario with no Sea Level Rise. This is the 
only pluvial flood hazard layer that evaluates pluvial flooding associated with present-day mean high tide (Mean 
Higher High Water; MHHW) levels. This scenario identifies areas that are the most highly exposed to pluvial flooding 
– i.e., those that would experience inundation greater than 4 inches even from a relatively modest rain event of 
approximately 2 inches in one hour. Because this precipitation event is roughly associated with a 10-year return 
period, exposure cannot be directly compared to that of the FEMA SFHA, which is associated with 100-year (1% 
AEP) flooding. This scenario also represents less rainfall than occurred during the Ida remnants cloudburst which, in 
most of the city was a much more extreme event than this Moderate scenario, was spatially varying, and occurred for 
different durations in different portions of the city. Further, this hazard layer is a synthetic event and does not capture 
any operational or environmental conditions, such as catch basins being clogged due to leaves, ice, and/or debris.

one hour) rain event. NYCHA buildings represent less than 1% of the total buildings inundated under this scenario. Map by NPCC4 
Fellow Fiona Dubay, Sarah Lawrence College.    
To estimate the number of buildings exposed to the Moderate pluvial flood scenario, we identified all buildings located 
within a 1 ft buffer of the simulated pluvial flood hazard area. Under this Moderate scenario 30,690 buildings would be 
exposed to stormwater inundation depths of greater than 4 inches. Of these exposed buildings, 16.7% (5,113)  are 
single-story buildings and 41.7% (12,796) of the exposed buildings have basements, cellars, or subgrade spaces. Of 
the exposed buildings,  30.7% (9,413)  are 1-2 residential unit buildings with subgrade spaces, and  0.36% (112) of 
the exposed buildings are part of NYCHA developments (Figure 8). In the interpretation of these results, it is 
important to note that the Stormwater Resiliency modeling assumes that ~2 inches of rain fall uniformly over the 
entire city. Such a scenario is unlikely to occur during an actual rain event.

4.4 
Climate Change and Future Pluvial Flooding 
Pluvial flooding is already a significant hazard for NYC, and it will be exacerbated by human-caused climate change 
throughout the 21st century, especially if global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are delayed. Climate 
change is expected to increase the probability of extremely intense, short-duration precipitation (Fowler, Lenderink, et 
al., 2021; Westra et al., 2014). Table 4 presents projected changes in the 10 yr (10% AEP) and 100 yr (1% AEP) 
precipitation accumulation falling in 1 hour. The relatively moderate (10 yr) cloudbursts that already cause pluvial 
flooding in some inland areas of the city (Figure 9) are projected to become 19 – 24% more intense. Greater potential 
increases are projected for more extreme (100 yr) storms, with 1-hour accumulations increasing by 20%, even if 
global emissions of heat trapping gases are reduced by mid-century, and by 30% under scenarios of unmitigated 
climate change. There is greater scientific uncertainty associated with these short-duration precipitation projections, 
compared with projections of future daily rainfall extremes (Fowler, Ali, Allan, Ban, Barbero, Berg, Blenkinsop, Cabi, 
Chan, & Dale, 2021). This consistent uncertainty presents a significant challenge for the design of stormwater 
infrastructure for pluvial flood resilience (L. M. Cook et al., 2020).

Along with projected increases in rainfall rates at any given location, recent studies have identified mechanisms that 
can result in increases in the areal extent over which intense rain falls with global warming (Y. Chen et al., 2021; 
Fowler, Lenderink, et al., 2021; Pendergrass, 2020). Most cloudbursts are highly localized and result in flooding only 
in small areas of the city at once, though these localized impacts can be severe and associated with life-threatening 
conditions in affected communities (B. R. Rosenzweig, McPhillips, et al., 2018). However, two of the most impactful 
historic pluvial flood events at the city-scale – the Ida Remnants Cloudburst and a cloudburst on August 8, 2007 that 
caused the unplanned shutdown of much of the subway system – were associated with organized systems of 
thunderstorms that resulted in extreme rainfall rates falling over widespread areas of the city (MTA, 2007; Smith et 
al., 2023).  A potential increase in the size and organization of future cloudbursts would have significant implications 
for the citywide impacts of pluvial flood events (Peleg et al., 2022), but scientific understanding of this topic remains in 
the earliest stages. 
Pluvial flooding may also be exacerbated in areas where groundwater tables rise in response to sea level rise 
(Section 7.4). In these areas, the ability for storm sewers to convey stormwater may be reduced by increased 
infiltration of groundwater into sewers (Liu et al., 2018; B. R. Rosenzweig, McPhillips, et al., 2018), leading to 
hydrologic overload (see above). Stormwater green infrastructure that utilizes infiltration may also be less effective as 
rising water tables reduce the volume of available unsaturated subsurface (K. Zhang & Chui, 2019).   
Figure 10 presents the area that would be inundated greater than 4 inches under the Stormwater Resiliency Study 
Extreme Scenario. In this scenario, 206,859 of currently existing buildings would be exposed to pluvial flooding. For 
comparison, 88,700 buildings were in the area inundated by Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy of 2012 (City of New York 
Office of the Mayor, 2013). However, as discussed previously, it is important to note that the Stormwater Resiliency 
modeling assumes that rainfall is uniform across the entire city, meaning this figure represents the ceiling of exposed 
buildings for a rainfall of this magnitude. A total of 32,918 (16%) of the buildings exposed in such a scenario are 
single-story buildings and nearly half (93,528; 45.6%) of these exposed buildings have subgrade spaces. The 
overwhelming majority (70,970) of the exposed buildings with subgrade spaces are 1-2 residential unit buildings 
(Figure 9). 897 (0.43%) of the exposed buildings are part of NYCHA developments, which are highlighted in Figure 
10.

Persistent Knowledge Gaps: Pluvial Flooding 
Along with remaining scientific uncertainty on future short-duration precipitation, there remain critical knowledge gaps 
that limit our understanding of how future precipitation intensification with climate change will impact flood risk: 
Monitoring of the hydrologic and hydraulic response and impacts of cloudbursts: There is currently very 
limited direct observational data on the hydrologic and hydraulic response to cloudbursts. Following the Ida-
Remnants Cloudburst, the US Geological Survey mapped inundation depths by surveying high-water marks in 
several severely impacted communities in New York City (Figure 7), but observational data on flooding in response to 
extreme rain remain very limited. The collection of direct, in-situ monitoring of street flooding is being piloted through 
the NYC FloodNet project (Silverman et al., 2022) (discussed in Section 10, but a sustained monitoring network of 
flooding depths, in-sewer water depths and flow rates, and in-situ rainfall rates is needed to understand the 
hydrologic and hydraulic response to extreme rain in NYC. There may also be opportunities to develop methods to 
assimilate existing monitoring data that is collected for other purposes, such as traffic cameras.  
Hazard Mapping: The pluvial flood hazard maps developed through the Stormwater Resiliency Study (City of New 
York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021) provide novel and critical information to support flood risk assessment.  
However, currently available maps only represent a very small selection of potential precipitation scenarios, and 
these maps are only able to identify areas where inundation exceeds depth thresholds (4 inches or 1 foot) at some 
point during the flood event. Additional hazard maps that represent a broader range of plausible cloudburst scenarios 
and provide information on flood rise time, fast-flowing water, exposure to toxic chemicals and pathogens, and 
inundation duration are needed to support emergency response and flood management planning, and climate 
adaptation. The development of these additional hazard layers remains limited by the computational resources 
needed for this type of modeling and the limited availability of observational data on flooding in NYC, also described 
further in Section 10.

Pluvial Flood Vulnerability:  As described in Section 3.4.1, the true costs of pluvial flooding to NYC residents 
remain poorly characterized. Additional work is needed to improve understanding of who is impacted by pluvial 
floods, in which ways, and incurring what tangible and intangible costs. 
5 Fluvial Flooding 
5.1 
Fluvial Flood Hazard Characterization 
Fluvial flood risks (also referred to as riverine flood risks) are caused when the stage of a river, creek, or stream 
exceeds the elevation of its banks. NYC’s inland areas were historically drained by a dense network of streams, 
nearly all of which were filled, with their flow redirected to subterranean stormwater sewers by the mid-20th century 
(Figure 1). Remaining freshwater stream channels include the Bronx River, Valley Stream (which flows along the 
eastern edge of the city and is the head of Jamaica Bay), and small inland creeks in Staten Island. These streams 
provide critical freshwater habitat within the city but can cause flooding when their water levels rise above bankfull 
stage (e.g. the water level in a creek or stream at which flooding of the banks begins to occur) during both 
cloudbursts and longer duration rain events. Fluvial flood risks within the city are mapped in the Special Flood Hazard 
Area (100-year floodplain) maps provided by FEMA, along with coastal flood hazards (FEMA, 2007, 2013). 
Fluvial flooding can be monitored directly using stream gauges, which provide in-situ measurements of stream water 
levels. Bankfull water levels are associated with inundation of the adjacent floodplain and can cause minimal societal 
impacts (if the floodplain is undeveloped) to moderate/major impacts if buildings, infrastructure, or other assets are 
located there. NPCC3 presented an assessment of fluvial flooding in regional streams outside the border of NYC with 
long-term gauge record. Additional research is needed to characterize fluvial flood risks within the city, especially in 
areas of the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island.  
5.2 
Historical Example: Ida-Remnants Cloudburst Fluvial Flooding 
At the time of writing, the only active stream gauge located within NYC is along the Bronx River at New York 
Botanical Garden, which provides observations from 2007– present.(USGS, 2016a) Over this period, 24 minor floods, 
7 moderate flood events, and 7 major floods (Table 5) were observed through 2022 at this site (Figure 11). In 
addition, a flood on July 19, 2022 damaged the stream gauge such that the peak flood stage could not be recorded.

Fluvial Flooding Exposure and Vulnerability 
5.3.1 
Buildings and critical infrastructure exposed to fluvial flooding 
Exposure to fluvial flooding was evaluated utilizing areas delineated in the FEMA SFHA that are adjacent to 
remaining inland water bodies. The FEMA SFHA excludes areas that would be flooded with depths less than 1 foot 
(0.3m), even though such shallow flooding could result in inundation of ground-floor and subgrade spaces. Based on 
this available hazard data, only 388 buildings are in areas that have a 1% AEP (100-year return interval) of flooding 
from inland streams and rivers (Figure 12). Of these buildings, 32.4% (126) are single-story buildings and 28.6% 
(111) of the total exposed buildings have identified subgrade spaces, which is somewhat lower than the percentage 
of buildings with subgrade spaces across the city. A total of 25.5% of the exposed buildings are 1-2 unit residential 
units with subgrade spaces. No NYCHA buildings are located in this inland fluvial hazard area.

However, areas adjacent to the Bronx River and small surface streams in Staten Island remain exposed. Source: Map by NPCC4 
Fellow Fiona Dubay, Sarah Lawrence College. 
5.4 
Climate Change and Future Fluvial Flooding 
As with pluvial flooding (Section 4.4), the projected amplification of precipitation with climate change will increase the 
frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods in the future. Fluvial flooding will also be exacerbated by sea level rise since 
NYC’s rivers and streams are tidal and drain to the harbor. Rising seas will impede this drainage and may increase 
groundwater levels and, in turn, stream baseflow, resulting in an increased frequency of stages that exceed flood 
thresholds (Habel et al., 2020; Moftakhari et al., 2017). FEMA Flood Insurance Studies do not consider changing 
precipitation patterns or groundwater levels with climate change and do not represent the increased fluvial flood 
hazard that will result from unmitigated climate change.

Our understanding of NYC’s fluvial flood risk and potential future changes is limited by the same gaps in short-
duration precipitation data discussed for pluvial flooding (Section 4.5). In addition, most of the residences exposed to 
fluvial flooding are in the flood hazard area of streams in Staten Island that are currently ungauged. The reactivation 
or installation of stream gauges along these high-exposure streams would support enhanced characterization of 
fluvial flood risk and the development of optimized strategies for fluvial flood resilience. As discussed in the section on 
pluvial flooding, an estimate of the annual cost of damages due to fluvial flooding on NYC residents is currently not 
available. However, since the chances of residents of floodplains having FEMA flood insurance are higher, estimates 
based on FEMA claims may be better estimates than for other flood hazard types.  
6 Coastal Flooding 
6.1 
Coastal Flood Hazard Characterization 
With 520 miles of shoreline (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021), NYC is exposed to severe coastal 
flooding resulting from high tides and storm surge, as demonstrated during Post Tropical Cyclone Sandy in 2012. 
Severe coastal floods are caused by two types of storms, predominantly tropical cyclones in warm seasons (June 
through October) and extratropical cyclones in cooler seasons (November through May)(Colle et al., 2010; P. M. 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment

Orton et al., 2016). Major factors influencing the occurrence of severe coastal floods include the timing of the wind- 
and pressure-driven storm surge relative to high tide (Kemp & Horton, 2013), and amplification of storm surges due to 
winds that blow into the concave coastline of the New York Bight (Gurumurthy et al., 2019). Chronic high-tide flooding 
is also a problem for some NYC neighborhoods, due to sea level rise, dredging, and landfilling of wetlands (Pareja‐
Roman et al., 2023). Present-day coastal flooding for monthly high tides were mapped for NYC by NPCC3 and 
include some localized areas around Jamaica Bay. (P. Orton et al., 2019a) Coastal extreme floods are mapped in the 
Special Flood Hazard Area maps provided by FEMA, which represent coastal or fluvial flood hazards only (FEMA, 
2007, 2013). 
6.2 
Historical Example: Coastal Flooding on December 23, 2022 
Extreme historical events such as Sandy and the 1821 Category 3 hurricane that struck NYC, with storm tides of 11.1 
and 9.8 ft (relative to the year’s mean sea level) at the Battery, respectively, have been a focus of widespread 
research in recent years (Brandon et al., 2014; P. M. Orton et al., 2016; Strauss et al., 2021). However, National 
Weather Service (NWS) designated “major floods” (Error! Reference source not found.) from less extreme storms 
have a factor of 10-20 higher annual probability of occurrence than these two historical extreme events today and 
even higher in future decades. See water-level return period curves in Orton et al. (P. M. Orton et al., 2016). Below, 
we highlight a recent major flood to raise awareness of these far more common but nevertheless dangerous and 
damaging events. 
In December 2022, a powerful, inland extratropical cyclone located over the Great Lakes Region caused winter storm 
impacts across the Midwest and northeastern United States. Although the storm was located hundreds of miles west 
of NYC, it generated powerful southeasterly winds that generated a storm surge along the coast. Early on the 
morning of December 23rd, a moderate 3-foot storm surge peaked simultaneously with one of the year’s highest tides 
to cause substantial flooding around NYC. Water levels across most of the city exceeded the moderate flood 
threshold of the NWS (see Figure 13), with those at the Battery peaking at 5.9 feet NAVD88, which is an 
approximately 3-year return period event. Water levels in Jamaica Bay (Figure 14), however, exceeded NWS major 
flood thresholds there and peaked at 6.7 feet above NAVD88 (Inwood, USGS gauge; Figure 13) (USGS, 2016b) 
which is an 8-year return period water level (P. M. Orton, Sanderson, et al., 2020) and the second highest in the bay’s 
20-year data record, behind (but ~3.9 feet below) Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy. The likely cause of Jamaica Bay’s 
high peak water levels relative to those elsewhere around NYC was local tide amplification which has raised 
perigean-spring (“king”) high tides by about 0.7 feet, due to a combination of historical dredging and urban 
development of wetlands surrounding the bay (Pareja‐Roman et al., 2023). Flood depths in some areas surrounding 
Jamaica Bay were observed by FloodNet sensors to be about 3 feet, whereas only shallow nuisance flooding was 
observed in the harbor areas (typically well below 1 ft). The relative sea level rise around NYC of ~1.3 feet since 1900 
was also clearly a contributor to these water elevations and flood depths.

6.3 
Coastal Flooding Exposure and Vulnerability 
Based on FEMA’s last completed Flood Insurance Study (FIS) (FEMA, 2013) 67,255 buildings are located in coastal 
areas that have a 100 yr return interval (1% AEP) of flooding in the contemporary climate. About 30% (20,197) of 
these buildings are single-story buildings and 33.1% (22,242) of the total exposed buildings have identified subgrade 
spaces.  Of the exposed buildings, 27.0% (18,176) are 1-2 unit residential units with subgrade spaces. Figure 15 and 
Figure 16 illustrate the extent of this exposure to NYC’s vulnerable populations by highlighting the NYCHA 
developments and 1-2 residential unit buildings with subgrade spaces in coastal areas threatened by inundation 
during a 100-year storm-surge event. Along with storm surge, coastal flooding can occur as a result of high-tide 
('sunny day') flooding, which will increase with sea level rise. Figure 17 highlights vulnerable 1-2 unit residential 
buildings that are exposed to present-day flooding when tide levels reach the Mean Monthly High Water (MMHW) 
level. No NYCHA buildings are in this current hazard area. For comparison, Figures 18 and 19 present NYCHA 
buildings and 1-2 unit residential buildings with basements that will be exposed to approximately monthly (MMHW) 
tidal flooding with 58 inches (1.47m) of sea level rise (NPCC 2080 Scenario) in the absence of adaptive flood risk 
management efforts.

6.4 
Climate Change and Future Coastal Flooding 
It is well-established that SLR will continue to increase the frequency and magnitude of NYC coastal floods (P. Orton 
et al., 2019a), but the potential role of changing storms is an area of high uncertainty and active research (Braneon et 
al., 2024). Present day and future coastal flood risks with sea level rise have been extensively described in previous 
NPCC reports. Patrick et al. (Patrick et al., 2019) and Orton et al. (P. Orton et al., 2019a) applied static and dynamic 
flood modeling to map coastal flood hazards, respectively. Orton et al. (P. Orton et al., 2019a) also updated the 
projections of future coastal flood risk considering monthly high tides and extreme storm surges across a broadened 
set of sea level rise projections. While there is consensus that atmospheric warming will likely intensify tropical 
cyclones in the future, cyclogenesis, storm frequency, and storm tracks are also likely to shift. As a result, there is 
considerable uncertainty and spatial variability in projections of future changes to storm surge and it remains an 
active research area that has not yet been incorporated into NPCC flood maps.

6.5 
Persistent Knowledge gaps 
There continues to be a need for deeper research into coastal storms, storm surges and climate change impacts in 
the NYC region. There remain persistent cross-study differences in estimates of present-day storm tide hazards 
(Cialone et al., 2015; Nadal-Caraballo et al., 2015; P. M. Orton et al., 2016), as well as future changes to hurricane-
driven storm surge. Hybrid storms like Sandy are poorly understood, as are the influences of climate change on such 
storms. These have all previously been noted as key uncertainties (P. Orton et al., 2019a).  
Secondary or periodic maxima in non-tidal anomalies after a storm surge event have been referred to under the 
general term of “resurgences” or “edge waves” (Munk et al., 1956) but are relatively poorly understood. What is 
known is that these resurgences cause extremely rapid drawdowns of water levels on the tail end of a storm surge 
event, then a resurgence of as much as 3.5 feet in water levels that can cause flooding about 7-8 hours later if it 
coincides with high tide (Ayyad et al., 2022; Munk et al., 1956). A broader concern is that a storm could cause an 
initial surge followed by a surprising resurgence into highly populated neighborhoods. Research is needed to assess 
the associated risk from such events, including flood modeling of extreme historical and potential future cases of 
resurgence. 
Post Tropical Cyclone Sandy’s flooding predominantly affected New York Harbor (southern and western areas of 
NYC), and the coincidence of peak storm surge with low tide spared areas of South Bronx and Northern Queens from 
more severe flooding (P. M. Orton, Conticello, et al., 2020). Extreme storm surges and flooding can affect these 
areas of NYC when hurricanes cross Long Island, causing extreme east winds and storm surges funneling down

 Interim Report for Public Release 
37 
Long Island Sound and into the East River, the relatively narrow but potentially important connection between Long 
Island Sound and New York Harbor. For example, the 1938 “Long Island Express” Hurricane set the historical record 
for water level in the upper East River (at Willets and Kings Points). Hurricane and extratropical cyclone coastal flood 
prediction models run by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2023) have poor 
resolution in the East River. The hydrodynamic model applied in the last FEMA study and now again in a current 
study showed its worst performance and widespread low-biased water levels for this storm event in the East River 
(FEMA, 2013). Potential deficiencies in modeling the East River may be undermining our understanding of coastal 
flood risk, as well as forecasting and emergency management, and should be further investigated. 
In the post-Sandy period, many adaptation policies and strategies have been put into operation. Studies to evaluate 
these strategies are ongoing, and the city has incorporated lessons learned from their experiences with Sandy in 
guidance for future coastal FRM projects (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate Resiliency, 2021). But more 
research is needed to fully document lessons learned ten years after Sandy, listing benefits and limits of coastal flood 
adaptation strategies that were adopted in response to that event.  
7 Groundwater Flooding 
7.1 
Groundwater Flood Hazard Characterization 
Groundwater flooding occurs when the elevation of the water table – a surface that can be used to represent the level 
at which the subsurface is saturated with water – is higher than that of the land surface or subterranean 
infrastructure, resulting in the inflow and/or infiltration of groundwater into these spaces (Habel et al., 2020; 
Macdonald et al., 2012). Groundwater flooding can occur in the absence of human activities, during very wet seasons 
or years when recharge rates greatly exceed evapotranspiration, resulting in a rise in the water table that inundates 
areas that are typically dry. But groundwater flooding has also become a globally-significant issue for cities that 
transition from the use of groundwater supply to other sources (Coda et al., 2019; Foster, 2020). As the water table 
rebounds from the lowered level induced by historical groundwater pumping, land areas that had previously been dry 
could more frequently become wet or waterlogged. 
The elevation of the water table is determined by the interaction of weather and climate, human water management 
activities, local topography, and subsurface hydrogeology. The subsurface structure of NYC is complex and varies 
across the city (NYC MOS, 2015). NYC is underlain by inclined crystalline basement rock that dips from northwest to 
southeast. Following this incline, the bedrock outcrops in parts of the Bronx and northern Manhattan, with generally 
thin overlying unconsolidated deposits in much of the Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island, and northwest Queens. Much 
of the remainder of Queens and Brooklyn are underlain by sand and gravel glacial deposits that increase in thickness 
with the sloped bedrock from nearly zero in northwest Queens to over 1,100 feet at the southeast edge of the city 
(Soren, 1971).These aquifers were historically pumped extensively for municipal supply, with pumping in the 
easternmost parts of the city continuing through the 1990s (Buxton & Shernoff, 1999). This pumping, over a period of 
many decades, contributed to a decrease in groundwater flow to streams and the coastal and inland wetlands left that 
remained in the urban area. 
In addition, many of the city's tidal creeks and coastal wetlands were extensively landfilled from the 18th through the 
20th centuries (Sanderson & Brown, 2007; Soren, 1971). Today, many of the city's coastal communities are underlain 
by urban fill materials, which are highly variable in thickness and composition across the city (Walsh, 1991; Walsh & 
LaFleur, 1995) In many of these areas, the hydrographic legacy of the historic stream corridors remains, and these 
areas are underlain by very shallow groundwater. The hydraulic properties of historic landfill materials also remain 
poorly characterized, with implications for the ability to predict groundwater levels and flow using numerical 
groundwater models.  
Areas underlain by shallow water tables (the surface representing the approximate depth to saturation with 
groundwater) may experience groundwater flooding during atypically wet seasons when the water table rises above 
the elevation of subterranean infrastructure or the land surface. Extensive areas of Brooklyn and Queens have an 
estimated depth to groundwater less than 10 feet (See Figure 20 in Monti et al. (Monti et al., 2013b)). Groundwater 
levels in other parts of NYC are very poorly characterized due to the more complex fractured bedrock geology and 
the lack of historic groundwater utilization and monitoring in these parts of the city.  
Groundwater flooding is an issue of particular concern in areas of the city that were developed during times when 
groundwater levels were artificially lowered through municipal groundwater pumping. This includes several 
neighborhoods in eastern Brooklyn and southern Queens that were developed in the mid- to late 20th centuries, 
when the surficial, Upper Glacial Aquifer was extensively pumped by the Flatbush, Woodhaven and Jamaica 
Franchise Areas of the New York Municipal Water Supply Company (Buxton & Shernoff, 1999). Many buildings and 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment

38 
other infrastructure in these areas were constructed by builders that were unaware that the water table was 
depressed by intensive pumping, or who assumed that pumping would continue indefinitely. When municipal 
pumping was discontinued due to saltwater intrusion and other water quality concerns, the water table rebounded, 
rising above the level of subterranean infrastructure such as basements and subway tunnels that had been 
constructed when groundwater levels were depressed through pumping (Soren, 1976). Many of these communities 
now require continuous groundwater pumping of basements and tunnels to prevent inundation and may face 
enhanced risk of groundwater flooding during wet seasons. 
7.2 
Historical Example: Groundwater Flooding in Lindenwood 
The Lindenwood section of East New York (located at the border of Brooklyn and Queens) is one of several 
communities across the city that is particularly exposed to groundwater flooding due to its development, topography 
and location near the coast of Jamaica Bay (Figure 20). Like many Jamaica Bay coastal communities, the depth to 
the water table underlying much of the Lindenwood area was estimated to be less than 10 feet in 2013 (Monti et al., 
2013b). Some areas of this community are located on landfilled historic riparian wetlands of Spring Creek and are 
particularly low in elevation. 
 
Figure 20: Shallow groundwater and subgrade infrastructure in East New York--Lindenwood. Subgrade subway tracks in this area 
already require pumping due to shallow groundwater.  In 2010, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection reported 
groundwater flooding in response to a street flooding service request in this area. Map by BR Rosenzweig 
Groundwater flooding has been a documented issue in East New York - Lindenwood since the 1970s, following the 
cessation of municipal pumping in the adjacent Woodhaven Franchise Area (Soren, 1976). This includes basement 
flooding and damage to building foundations due to the elevated water tables. In addition, a 311 service request for 
street flooding in this area was attributed to a groundwater flooding condition (Unique Key # 16370230 on 4/3/2010 
(NYC 311, 2010).

 Groundwater Flooding Exposure and Vulnerability 
7.3.1 
Buildings and critical Infrastructure exposed to groundwater flooding 
No groundwater flood hazard maps are currently available for the city. As an alternative, for this assessment, we use 
areas where the depth to the water table has been mapped as shallow as a proxy for areas that may be exposed to 
groundwater flooding in the future. The USGS conducts an annual synoptic survey of groundwater levels observed in 
monitoring wells on Long Island each April and May. This surveyed data of the water table elevation is used to 
develop a map of ‘Depth to Water’ - the distance from the land surface to the water table. When observational data 
were available, this survey included groundwater levels in the NYC boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, which are 
located on Long Island. At present, April-May 2013 is the most recent period for which groundwater monitoring data is 
available for these two boroughs, although the USGS and NYCDEP are planning to reestablish groundwater 
monitoring in these two boroughs and across the city for future assessment of groundwater hazard.  
The 2013 Depth to Water layer was used to identify areas of Brooklyn and Queens where the depth to the water table 
was less than 10 feet below the land surface – this threshold was determined based on the accuracy of the Depth to 
Water layer Como et al. (2018). In these two boroughs 83,800 buildings are located in areas where the depth to the 
water table is less than 10 feet. Of these buildings, 33,996 (40.6%)  have subgrade spaces and of these buildings, 
28,411 (33.9% of the total exposed) are 1-2 residential unit buildings. 
Figure 21 and Figure 22 illustrate the extent of shallow groundwater in NYC’s boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, and 
locations of vulnerable buildings (NYCHA developments and 1-2 story residential buildings with subgrade spaces).

7.4 
Climate Change and Future Groundwater Flooding 
Climate change can potentially exacerbate existing groundwater flood hazards through two mechanisms: First, the 
projected increases in annual precipitation with climate change (Braneon et al., 2024) may result in a net increase in 
recharge to the city’s surficial aquifers, elevating the water table. However, when the water table is near the land 
surface, the impact of increased precipitation may be partially mitigated by concomitant increases in 
evapotranspiration with warmer temperatures (Smerdon, 2017). Predicting climate change impacts on groundwater 
recharge will be particularly challenging in NYC, where leakage to and from sewers significantly contributes to the 
subsurface water balance (Buxton & Shernoff, 1999; Buxton & Smolensky, 1999). 
The second mechanism results from the impacts of sea level rise on groundwater elevation and flow (Figure 23). At 
the coast, seawater and groundwater function as a system, coupled through the flow of fresh groundwater towards 
the sea and the intrusion of dense, saline seawater into coastal aquifers. Close to the shore and assuming uniform 
soil properties, the water table will stabilize to an elevation that is just above the increased local mean sea level at 
steady-state (S. W. Chang et al., 2011; Strack, 1976), resulting in emergence at the surface and inundation of areas 
with shallower water tables - even if they were otherwise protected from direct coastal inundation by floodwalls or 
dunes at the shore (Habel et al., 2020; Rotzoll & Fletcher, 2013). In relatively flat, humid areas such as NYC, this 
water table rise will be limited by surface drainage once the water table emerges at the lowest-elevation areas, a 
process described as ‘topography-limitation’ (Michael et al., 2013). For example, in a numerical modeling study, 
Befus et al. (2020) found that surface drainage at topographic low areas significantly limited the areal extent of water 
table rise in response to rising sea levels across the state of California. However, in NYC, this topography-limitation

41 
effect could actually lead to concentrated groundwater flooding in populated, low-elevation areas of the city where 
groundwater drains at the surface – even if changes in the depth-to-water in other parts of the city is stabilized 
through this process. Communities developed in the legacy valleys of filled streams would be particularly exposed to 
risk through this mechanism. In addition, once the water table rise is stabilized by groundwater emergence at the 
surface, the groundwater freshwater-saline interface will begin advancing inland (S. W. Chang et al., 2011; Werner & 
Simmons, 2009), a process known as saltwater intrusion that would exacerbate corrosion damage of subterranean 
infrastructure located below the water table and harm to inland NNBS that are not adapted for saltwater as described 
previously (Tansel & Zhang, 2022). Courtney et al. (Courtney et al., 2023) found evidence that tidal fluctuations are 
propagating further into a Hudson River tidal wetland today more so than they were 20 years ago.

7.5 
Persistent Knowledge Gaps: Groundwater Flooding 
The idealized case of a uniform groundwater aquifer at steady state that we described above provides a useful first 
assessment of the potential magnitude of water table rise due to sea level rise, and this assessment has been utilized 
in previous studies of climate change and urban groundwater flooding (Rotzoll & Fletcher, 2013; Sukop et al., 2018). 
However, actual groundwater conditions and the response to sea level rise in NYC will be determined by our local 
aquifer and infrastructure conditions (Bonneau et al., 2017; Sharp et al., 2003). As such, care should be taken in 
drawing conclusions from studies completed for different locales and spatial scales. In NYC, groundwater conditions 
are not idealized in that water table elevations will be influenced by sewers (Liu et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019, 2022) 
and site-scale groundwater pumping for dewatering, which may mitigate the amount of water table change due to sea 
level rise but exacerbate saltwater intrusion. Furthermore, changes to historic shorelines and low-lying areas that 
were filled as the NYC area was developed will also influence groundwater response to sea level rise and 
groundwater recharge (Mancini et al., 2020). Nonetheless, these initial, available studies are useful in identifying 
potential risks and considerations for evaluating NYC’s groundwater flooding hazards.  
In addition, the steady-state assumption does not allow for the assessment of the timing of the groundwater response 
to sea level rise. Numerical models that can simulate the transient water table response in heterogenous aquifer 
systems can provide enhanced understanding of groundwater flood hazard under different scenarios of sea level rise 
(Habel et al., 2019), but the predictive skill of these models is highly dependent on the availability of data on spatially 
distributed aquifer properties, the location and depth of sewers and subterranean groundwater drainage systems, and 
on observations of groundwater levels for model calibration and validation (Bosserelle et al., 2022). 
Understanding sea level rise impacts on the shallow groundwater system in NYC in light of anthropogenic influences 
(e.g. urban drainage systems) is the subject of an upcoming U.S. Geological Survey study (USGS, Personal 
Communication, March 8, 2024). The USGS has signed an agreement with NYCDEP to reestablish, operate, and 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
42 
maintain a hydrologic-monitoring network program in NYC designed to focus on groundwater-flooding assessment, 
resiliency efforts, and hazards mitigation.  
As the groundwater monitoring wells are reactivated, the USGS-NYCDEP study will focus on the following elements:  
■ 
Conducting applied research to aid in the efficient and economical implementation of groundwater flooding 
abatement systems. 
■ 
Developing a groundwater map for Staten Island to inform current and future design of Bluebelt stormwater 
management corridors.  
■ 
Investigating and modeling the effects of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion upon the groundwater system 
and Bluebelts in Queens and Staten Island. 
■ 
Investigating and modeling potential ground subsidence resulting from a lowered groundwater table. 
Additional research is needed to improve understanding of how sea level rise could increase groundwater flood 
hazards and associated impacts on the city’s infrastructure systems on a site-by-site basis. A higher water table could 
increase the need for pumping to  the inundation of subways, tunnels, utility vaults and other subterranean 
infrastructure by infiltrating groundwater. Increased pumping will require increased electricity demands. In addition, if 
the pumped water is discharged directly into nearby waterways. This could also result in increased loading of 
nutrients or other groundwater contaminants to these water bodies. For example, Benotti et al. (2007) estimated that 
contemporary subway dewatering contributes to nitrogen loading in NYC’s Jamaica Bay.  
Rising water tables could also reduce the conveyance capacity of sanitary and stormwater drainage systems and limit 
exfiltration of stormwater from the base of green stormwater infrastructure facilities (Liu et al., 2018; K. Zhang & Chui, 
2019), potentially exacerbating pluvial flooding (Section 4.1). At higher elevations, groundwater can also infiltrate into 
septic systems (Habel et al., 2020) and reduce the service life of pavements (Knott et al., 2017, 2018). Limited 
information is available regarding the impact of rising groundwater levels on shoreline flood protection infrastructure 
such as sea walls and levees, and specifically the potential for groundwater flooding inland of these systems that 
could reduce their overall effectiveness (Habel et al., 2020; Rotzoll & Fletcher, 2013). 
8 Compound Flooding 
8.1 
Compound Flooding Hazard Characterization 
The impacts of NYC’s four flood hazards (coastal, fluvial, pluvial, groundwater) can be compounded when they occur 
in combination. For example, a tropical cyclone that brings both heavy rain and storm surge could result in coastal, 
fluvial, and pluvial flooding. An intense rainstorm that occurs in the spring or during a very wet season when 
groundwater tables are elevated could result in both groundwater and pluvial flooding (Corada-Fernández et al., 
2017). Future climate change and sea level rise could aggravate the effects of compound floods by increasing their 
frequency (Lai et al., 2021) or altering the co-occurrence of flood drivers (Ward et al., 2018). An initial analysis of 
historical observations found that the likelihood of joint occurrence of extreme rainfall and storm surge within a given 
storm system (defined as a three-day window) has increased over the past century, possibly due to climate change 
(Wahl et al., 2015). 
Federal risk assessment and forecasting have, however, rarely incorporated multiple flood hazards into flood 
modeling due to the limited capabilities of existing models and lack of statistical assessments of compounding factors 
(P. Orton et al., 2012). Compounding of floodwater sources has not been incorporated into flood hazard mapping 
from FEMA (e.g. flood insurance rate maps) or NOAA (e.g. SLOSH Maps) (NOAA National Hurricane Center, 2023; 
Zachry et al., 2015). This deficiency is gradually being addressed, with new models being developed and methods 
applied to better assess compounding. For example, the USGS New York Water Science Center is assessing 
compound flood risk from the combined effects of sea level rise on storm surge, tidal and groundwater flooding, and 
stormwater (United States Geological Survey, 2021). This research project is exploring and mapping vulnerability to 
individual and co-occurring flood drivers across the project study area, which includes NYC. The study also includes 
developing a coupled model framework that links coastal, groundwater and stormwater models to better understand 
the dynamics connecting surface stormwater, coastal ocean, and groundwater. 
The most widespread compound flood hazard for NYC is likely compound hazard from rain and storm surge, given 
that coastal and pluvial flooding commonly co-occur during coastal storms. Analyses of historical data under the 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
43 
Climate VIA project have quantified the baseline present-day hazard from co-occurrence of these two drivers (Z. 
Chen et al., in Preparation). The research focused on simultaneous and near-simultaneous rain and storm surge 
through analysis of hourly historical data because NYC is located on several small, heavily urbanized watersheds, 
where the time of concentration is short, and rain and surge must be nearly simultaneous to cause compounding. 
This is an improvement upon prior assessments that analyzed daily rain totals and looked at three-day windows for 
assessing co-occurrences (Lai et al., 2021; Wahl et al., 2015). The new analyses included ranked correlations of rain 
and surge and joint return period analyses. Storm types were separated into tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones 
and “neither” events (e.g. localized convective thunderstorms) using historical storm track datasets. 
The results of this new research reveal non-zero correlations between rain and storm surge, suggesting that there is 
a higher probability of one variable being extreme when the other is extreme. When all storm types are merged 
together, rain and surge have a low, but non-zero rank correlation. However, for TC data alone, their correlation can 
be high. In addition, when one of the two flood drivers is extreme (the “primary” driver), the magnitude of the 
secondary flood driver during TCs is much higher than for other storm types. Even though they occur less frequently 
than extratropical cyclones or other storm events, rain and surge during the most extreme cases (the upper tail region 
of the probability distribution) are more correlated for TCs than for all events combined (a combined assessment). 
Assessing extreme (50- and 100-year) joint rain-surge events from TCs gives a worse rain and surge hazard than 
assessing all events combined. As a result, TCs require separate hazard assessments to avoid underestimation of 
extreme compound flood hazards (Z. Chen et al., in Preparation). 
The timing of the joint flood drivers is also important to their potential compounding. For TCs alone, there are 
moderate negative correlations between peak rain intensity and the lag to peak surge, indicating that the most 
intense TC rain and surge events (e.g.,100-year) have the most potential for simultaneous extreme flood drivers and 
thus, compounding. Prior studies have only focused on New York Harbor (the Battery) but a paired assessment of 
Kings Point tide gauge data addresses compound flood hazard for South Bronx and Northern Queens. It showed this 
area has qualitatively similar compound rain-surge compound hazard characteristics. However, we found the peak 
surge at Kings Point tends to have 2-6 hours of lag time behind the peak rain rate during TCs (due to slow surge 
propagation along Long Island Sound). This could reduce the risk of pluvial-coastal compound flood hazard but raises 
the risk of fluvial-coastal compound flood in nearby Bronx River.  
8.2 
Historical Example: Tropical Storm Irene 
Tropical Storm Irene 2011 hit NYC with a large storm surge (4.2 feet at the Battery), high coastal water levels, and 
simultaneous heavy rainfall. The compounding by rain and river streamflow increased peak water levels only very 
slightly (2%) in New York Harbor (P. Orton et al., 2012). No street flood sensor observations or flood modeling 
existed for NYC during that storm, but the combination of “moderate” to “major” NWS coastal flood levels along 
shorelines of NYC and heavy rainfall (as much as 3.3 cm in 1 hour; 14.4cm in 12 hours) may have caused compound 
flooding. This lack of quantitative evidence has motivated efforts to deploy hundreds of real-time flood sensors on 
streets (City of New York et al., 2024; Silverman et al., 2022) and to develop hydrologic and hydraulic models of the 
city (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021), both of which can be used to quantify compound flooding 
and better understand the potential efficacy of mitigation strategies. 
8.3 
Compound Flooding Exposure and Vulnerability 
While very little detailed quantification of on-the-ground compound flooding has been possible until recently, areas 
believed to experience compound flooding are typically in coastal flood zones, and include locations like East New 
York, The Rockaways, and Gowanus. In-situ observation efforts like FloodNet, are poised to greatly expand the data 
available to quantify the City’s flooding. 
8.4 
Climate Change and Future Compound Flooding 
Given the relatively new science of compound flooding, relatively little research has looked at quantifying future 
trends. However, rising sea levels alone are likely to cause worsened compounding of pluvial flooding in coastal 
floodplains, and any intensification of rainfall extremes could similarly compound coastal floods. Recent work by Gori 
et al. (2022) showed that extreme rain and surge correlations could rise by up to 25% by 2100 due to climate change, 
and both SLR and storm climatology changes are important to the rainfall-surge joint hazard at the NY/NJ area. The 
recent Stormwater Resiliency Study (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021) assessed future rain 
intensity change and SLR impacts on pluvial flooding. Research prior to that study used global climate model results 
for changes to extreme rainfall and used simplified conservative (high-end flooding) modeling approaches by 
assuming it is always during the high tide for all the extreme rainfall scenarios (Ghanbari et al., Submitted).

8.5 
Persistent Knowledge Gaps: Compound Flooding 
Completed recent research (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021) has mainly focused on pluvial 
flooding and sea level rise, but more comprehensive research on all flood hazard types, including groundwater and 
Bronx River-fluvial compound flooding is needed. Moreover, rain-surge compounding is also increased by tides, and 
thus quantification of the joint rain-surge-tide probabilities is important for determining the compound flooding. While 
most research to date has focused on less-frequent, extreme compound events, more research on the chronic 
flooding that will result from more-frequently occurring high tides and the infiltration of groundwater into storm sewers 
is needed.   
A critical next step will be compound flood modeling and analyses of street flood observations alongside the results of 
statistical assessments like those summarized above, to translate these data into an understanding of actual on-the-
ground impacts; two drivers can co-occur, but their combined flood depth is often less than their sum. 
Further use of 311 flood-related service requests and NYC FloodNet Street Flooding observations (Silverman et al., 
2022) can greatly aid these research endeavors. The impact of climate change on compound flooding is another area 
of future research. The improved understanding of past and present-day compound flood hazards presented above 
helps identify the factors needed to study future changes in compound flooding. For example, tropical and post-
tropical cyclones are an important area of study for the most extreme compounding events, and the climatological 
changes to these storms are an important area for future research. 
9 Flood Risk Management (FRM) 
9.1 
Context for Flood Risk Management (FRM) 
As discussed throughout this chapter, NYC’s ecology and development history play an important role in 
contextualizing the geography of the city’s contemporary flood risks. Many of today’s flood hazard areas were 
historically natural streams and wetlands (Figure 1) that flooded regularly. But the risks associated with pre-
urbanization flooding in these areas were low since the ecological communities found there were well-adapted to 
these conditions, and the human population exposed to these floods was relatively low. Contextually, this pre-
urbanization level of flood risk can be viewed as an unavoidable floor (Figure 24, left), below which risk cannot be 
reduced. It is worth noting that even if the NYC metropolitan area had never urbanized, flood hazards – and in turn, 
flood risk - would have continued to increase through the 20th century, due to the effects of global climate change on 
sea level and precipitation patterns (as represented by the yellow box on the first column).

boxes represent increases in flood risk due to climate change. The heights of the green, grey, and blue bars represent NYC flood 
risks in pre-developed, conventionally developed, and adapted/transformed states, respectively. The solid arrow represents the

As the city urbanized, streams were filled and natural areas were replaced with impervious surfaces, the potentially 
exposed population grew into the millions and flood risks for people greatly increased (Figure 24, middle). More 
people and infrastructure systems were exposed to each flood, without the natural buffering provided by the historical 
ecological systems. As in cities across the country (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 
2019; Wasley et al., 2023), the impacts of flooding came to be experienced differently across different populations. As 
evidenced by the severity of flood impacts documented throughout this chapter, this existing level of flood risk is 
already high and climate change (e.g. yellow box, middle column) will raise it further. Given the extensive work by 
NPCC and other researchers to quantify the potential effects of climate change on the city, and the growing attention 
being given to flood risk management, the current level of flood risk ought to represent a ceiling, above which future 
flood risks are not allowed to rise.  
To orient adaptation investments made in the city, there is a need for open, public, inclusive, multi-stakeholder 
deliberation about the range of future flood risks that are acceptable to NYC residents. This deliberation is a 
necessary precursor to adaptation decisions which are inherently political and driven by values – both expressed and 
unexpressed - about what to preserve, what to change, and what to allow to evolve in an un-managed fashion (Mach 
& Siders, 2021). Adaptation decisions will have long-term, legacy implications and will create path dependencies that 
cut off future options available to reduce flood risks (Haasnoot et al., 2021), especially in the neighborhoods directly 
impacted by them. At this important phase in the city’s dynamic development, community members need to work with 
governmental decision-makers, scientists, and others to decide what level of future flood risks they are willing to 
accept in their communities, and which of many adaptation pathways (e.g. unique combination of FRM approaches) 
will be pursued to achieve those goals. An overview of the FRM options that are available is provided in the next 
section.   
9.2 
Scope of Flood Risk Management (FRM) 
Flood risk management (FRM) is an evolving term used to describe a variety of structural and non-structural 
approaches – or responses - (Figure 25) that seek to decrease the human and ecological impacts of floods. As 
defined here, following UNDRR (2023) and (Wasley et al., 2023), structural measures include some form of physical 
infrastructure, or the application of engineering, including nature-based engineering, to reduce flood risks. Non-
structural measures use knowledge, practice, agreements, laws, policies, capacity building, financing, and public 
awareness raising and educational campaigns to accomplish the same goals. FRM seeks to minimize the impacts of 
climate change through mitigation (Sharifi, 2021); reduction in inundation exposure through gray- and nature-based 
approaches (Depietri & McPhearson, 2017; L. E. McPhillips et al., 2021; P. M. Orton et al., 2015); and a reduction in 
vulnerability factors (Kim et al., 2019; Rufat et al., 2015). FRM can be planned by government agencies with a 
responsibility for water or flood management but can also be initiated by flood-exposed stakeholders themselves. 
When FRM actions have the unintended consequence of increasing flood risk, they can lead to maladaptation (see 
Section 3.5).

47 
Decisions regarding FRM are complex because they involve selecting which combination of responses should be 
implemented, at what spatial and temporal scales, to manage which types of floods, with what intended impact, and 
through what kinds of partnerships and collaborations. Over the past two decades, the principles guiding FRM have 
evolved rapidly. There has been a shift from responses that sought principally to control floods, to responses that 
made it easier to live with them, to most recently learning and change processes that sought to fundamentally 
transform communities to reduce risk in the long-term (Rözer et al., 2022; L. Wang et al., 2022). Prior to this century, 
FRM responses were predominantly reactive, structural, and undertaken after a flood occurred. Today, increasingly – 
though perhaps not fast or widely enough - FRM is viewed as a critical component of a multifaceted, pro-active 
strategy that seeks to reduce the vulnerability and increase the livability of flood prone communities before, during, 
and after flooding events, in the context of climate change and ongoing urbanization (Abdel-Mooty et al., 2022; Cea & 
Costabile, 2022).  
Martin-Breen and Anderies (Martin-Breen & Anderies, 2011) introduced a taxonomy that can be used to define 
different classes of FRM adaptation responses. This schema differentiates between Resistance-based responses 
that seek to “bounce back” to pre-flood ‘normal’ conditions (e.g. the Resistance Approach)(Abdulkareem & Elkadi, 
2018; Liao, 2012), and Resilience-based responses that involve either an incremental adaptation to a new post-flood 
‘normal’ state (e.g. the Adaptive Approach), or a fundamental transformation of the social and ecological conditions 
that determine flood risk (e.g. the Transformative Approach) (Martin-Breen & Anderies, 2011). The Resistance 
approach to FRM fundamentally seeks to preserve the status quo in the exposed community by ‘fighting with water’ in 
different ways to keep it away from where it can have negative impacts. It is typically applied at larger spatial scales, 
for example by building a levee, seawall, or flood gate dyke (McClymont et al., 2020). If it exacerbates flooding 
elsewhere, it can lead to maladaptation. The two Resilience approaches involve decentralized actions inside 
communities but at different scales and for different purposes as broken down below: 
• 
Because it recognizes the need for exposed communities to ‘live with water’, the Adaptive approach may 
incentivize property retrofits (e.g. various forms of floodproofing, and/or elevation of buildings or utilities) or 
other measures that prepare that community for a specific future condition.  
• 
Recognizing the same need, the Transformation approach does not adopt any fixed end point (e.g. either 
a historical or future normal condition) as the goal for FRM. Rather, it accepts that climate change (and other 
social and ecological processes) is creating a dynamic, evolving context in which continuous societal 
change and transformation will be needed, for example determining where and how people live, and where 
and how natural systems are integrated into developed landscapes. Like the Adaptive resilience approach, 
these changes can be decentralized and small-scale. But like the Resistance approach, these changes 
could also drastically modify how entire communities look and feel. All three approaches can be 
implemented through various combinations of structural and non-structural measures, but with significantly 
different end goals governing how they are applied.  
9.3 
Pros, Cons, and Caveats of Different FRM strategies 
It is crucial that decision-makers, community members, and others be cognizant of the challenges and tradeoffs 
associated with different FRM responses as they collaborate to design comprehensive FRM strategies for specific 
districts, neighborhoods, or properties in NYC. An overview of these factors is provided below.  
9.3.1 
Resistance responses 
Resistance responses can be among the fastest and easiest ways to provide immediate protection to existing 
communities, though recent reviews (Cea & Costabile, 2022; McClymont et al., 2020), point to several potential 
unintended consequences (e.g. maladaptation) specifically of the engineered components of this approach: 
■ 
Resistance strategies frequently prioritize flood control over the need to conserve, restore, and/or create 
natural systems, undervaluing the natural water regulating services that NNBS provide. Historical investments 
in engineered flood control measures nationwide often came at the expense of NNBS, increasing natural 
systems vulnerability (McClymont et al., 2020), and reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services. In 
urban contexts, a general lack of understanding about how to integrate natural systems into the built 
environment resulted in a significant loss in the ability of natural systems to buffer the impacts of floods. 
Resistance strategies can cost-effectively reduce flood frequency and associated impacts and can also be 
designed to protect vulnerable NNBS. However, these same responses can also result in negative ecological 
impacts. These negative impacts could include changes in sedimentary systems, water column stratification, 
animal migration and habitat connectivity (P. Orton et al., 2023). Tognin et al (2021) documented how 
operation of the Venice storm surge barrier can reduce episodic sediment supply to tidal wetlands, 
compromising their ability to provide ecosystem services. Barriers can provide a temporary solution to sea 
level rise but set up difficult long-term choices between natural system function and human welfare. Already, 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
48 
many existing surge barriers are being closed with increasing frequency due to sea level rise, reflecting the 
potential for their overuse (P. Orton et al., 2023). 
■ 
Some Resistance strategies can cause maladaptation by transferring flood hazards from one location to 
another. For example, sea walls and levees like those under consideration by the US Army Corps of Engineers 
as part of the NY & NJ Harbor and Tributaries Focus Area Feasibility Study (NYNJHATS) can, under some 
conditions, increase water levels and induce flooding both upstream and downstream of them (Hummel et al., 
2021). 
■ 
Once built, Resistance designs can be difficult to retrofit and adapt. This obduracy (Chester et al., 2019) can 
result in their eventual failure and obsolescence as the climate and other conditions continue to change around 
them.  
■ 
Resistance strategies can cause a false sense of security (“the levee effect”) among residents in the protected 
community who believe that the risk of flooding has been eliminated. If this perception results in less flood 
preparedness, cancelled insurance policies, or if it leads to more development in these communities, it can 
increase risk in the long-term (National Research Council, 2013), even if it initially drops, and especially if 
future sea level rise turns out to be greater than the rates assumed by the levee designers (Han et al., 2020). 
■ 
When such systems fail, the consequences can be worse than would arise without protection, since other flood 
preparation measures may not be in place (F. Zhang et al., 2020). 
■ 
By controlling floods, Resistance strategies reduce the capacity of communities for episodic adaptation and 
learning, compounding vulnerability over time. 
■ 
By reducing personal experiences of flooding, public understanding of floods and motivation for planning and 
implementation of FRM can become limited to public messaging and general information, increasing latent 
risks.  
9.3.2 
Resilience responses 
By adapting and/or transforming communities, Resilience responses reduce flood vulnerability. However, as 
synthesized by (McClymont et al., 2020; Rözer et al., 2022), Resilience responses also present several key 
challenges:  
■ 
As broached in the Futures and Transitions Chapter, Resilience Strategies that require individual actions (e.g. 
elevating utilities, downloading an app) require that local stakeholders have access to information and 
resources about flooding. Local stakeholders also need agency in FRM decision-making, and the ability to self-
organize if they are to have the capacity to implement these measures. 
■ 
By prioritizing decentralized local measures, Resilience strategies can have the unintended consequence of 
shifting flood management responsibility from government to flood vulnerable groups who may not have the 
knowledge or resources to design, implement, and maintain FRM in the long term. 
■ 
These strategies can be logistically, socially, and institutionally complex to implement since they must modify a 
large fraction of the flood vulnerable area to meaningfully reduce overall risks and require collaboration among 
multiple stakeholders. 
■ 
The Transformative approach can also imply significant demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural changes, 
with potential implications for environmental and climate justice – both positive and negative – that must be 
considered. 
9.3.3 
Natural and Nature-based Systems (NNBS) responses 
To address the historical, anthropogenic dimensions of flood hazards, many FRM plans include NNBS. Under the 
right conditions, NNBS can provide flood protection and mitigation in both short-term and long-term FRM plans 
(Bridges et al., 2021; L. McPhillips et al., 2023). However, in their current highly modified configuration, NYC’s NNBS 
would need to be significantly enhanced and expanded if they are to address the most significant flood hazards 
facing the city.   
 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
49 
Some of the flood reducing ecosystem services of NNBS include:  
■ 
Storm surge attenuation: High elevation and continuous salt marshes can reduce storm surges by 1.7-25 
cm/km, especially when the marsh has a high elevation and is continuous (Leonardi et al., 2018; Wamsley et 
al., 2010).  
■ 
Wave attenuation and reduction in erosion: Even salt marshes that are too small to mitigate storm surges can 
be an effective means of attenuating storm-driven wind waves, reduce wave related flooding, and reduce 
erosion (Marsooli et al., 2017). Depending on the density and condition of marsh vegetation, these systems 
can attenuate waves with up to 95% reduction in wave energy occurring over just 100 meters of marsh with 
50% vegetation cover, and this same attenuation over even shorter distances with denser vegetation 
(Castagno et al., 2022).  
■ 
Mitigation of fluvial flows: Stream restoration and stream daylighting can help spread out and dissipate fluvial 
floodwaters (Swadek et al., 2021).  
■ 
Mitigation of soil crust formation: Terrestrial vegetation canopies can play a key role in protecting urban soils 
from the impact of raindrops, which could otherwise break up soil particles and create a surface crust that, in 
turn, reduces infiltration and increases runoff (Alizadehtazi et al., 2020).  
■ 
Stormwater management: In addition to NYCDEP’s standard ROW GI, urban parks (Feldman et al., 2019), 
vegetated urban yards (Mason & Montalto, 2015), and Stormwater Capture Greenstreets (Catalano De Sousa 
et al., 2016) can also be used to attenuate urban runoff, and can contribute to reducing the severity of flooding 
during extreme rain events when designed with low hydraulic loading ratios (e.g. the ratio of the tributary 
catchment area to the GI facility area) and/or as part of a comprehensive, watershed-level approach. Green 
roofs (Abualfaraj et al., 2018) and various kinds of permeable urban surfaces (both vegetated and 
unvegetated) will not yield runoff during moderate rain events that occur in NYC (Alizadehtazi et al., 2016).   
■ 
Mitigation of coastal flooding: A novel NNBS approach of shallowing estuary bathymetry has been shown to be 
particularly effective for reducing coastal flooding around Jamaica Bay (Marsooli et al., 2017; P. M. Orton et 
al., 2015; Stevens Institute of Technology et al., 2015). While it is well-established that historical dredging, 
landfill and wetland loss in the Bay are a major factor in current tidal and extreme event flooding (P. M. Orton, 
Sanderson, et al., 2020; Pareja‐Roman et al., 2023; Stevens Institute of Technology et al., 2015), only limited 
research has been conducted into the potential for this type of NNBS to be used solely or in combination with 
hard infrastructure or non-structural approaches for mitigating flooding for mitigating Jamaica Bay flooding. 
The flood protection value of NNBS is, however, highly dependent on local conditions, design (Wong et al., 2020), 
and the scale (e.g. land area) over which these systems can be implemented. The following factors limit the ability of 
existing NNBS to provide FRM services in NYC.  
■ 
Limited remaining wetland extent: The large area of salt marsh that would be required to effectively reduce 
coastal flooding does not exist in NYC due to its natural deep harbor and 20th century development with landfill 
on marshes (P. M. Orton et al., 2015).  
■ 
Siting and design of engineered NNBS: Stormwater management practices designed for water quality 
improvement or CSO management are typically intended to capture only the first 1-2 inches of rainfall over 
their tributary drainage area (TDA) because that ‘design storm’ (Markolf et al., 2021) generates a volume of 
stormwater (e.g. the ‘water quality volume’) that is greater than the volume of runoff produced by 80-90% of all 
annual rain events. That volume of runoff is also believed to contain the ‘first flush’ of pollutants that, if 
captured, provide significant reductions in pollutant loads. GI and other stormwater management practices that 
are sized to capture more than the water quality volume are often considered overdesigned and prohibitively 
expensive (L. M. Cook et al., 2020). GI and other stormwater management practices designed for water quality 
improvement may thus be too small to mitigate pluvial flooding associated with larger events. For example, 
Figure 27 compares the NYCDEP design storm depths associated with site and house connections in 
combined sewer districts to the total accumulation of precipitation during some recent extreme precipitation 
events. The ability of GI and other stormwater management practices to intercept street runoff can be 
compromised by inlet clogging, and is inversely correlated to the peak rate and volume of TDA runoff 
(Catalano De Sousa et al., 2016; Shevade et al., 2020), which are both expected to increase with climate 
change. GI and other stormwater management practices would need to be made bigger or significantly 
upscaled to provide FRM as a co-benefit. In its Citywide Cloudburst Program, NYCDEP is piloting a variety of 
strategies for managing larger quantities of stormwater using curbside porous pavements and stormwater

50 
retention sites located both inside and outside of the right-of-way (City of New York Department of 
Environmental Protection, 2023), but planning and design these projects are still in the early stages.  
■ 
Green gentrification: Some concern over the potential for NNBS to lead to gentrification has also been 
expressed. Various forms of NNBS which, in the right configurations, can detain stormwater, reduce waves, 
and otherwise help to reduce some kinds of flood risks can also increase property values and housing prices, 
ultimately resulting in the displacement of working-class residents and racialized groups and cultures (“the 
greenspace paradox”) (Anguelovski et al., 2022). Parks have been positively associated with gentrification 
processes in mid-sized cities across North America and Western Europe (Triguero-Mas et al., 2022). In NYC, 
research into this maladaptive role of green spaces is limited. Li (2023) found that the Million Trees initiative 
raised housing values and attracted more white, educated, and young households, but did not lead to 
significant gentrification. By contrast, Black and Richards (2020) found that The High Line increased housing 
values closest to it by 35.3%, exacerbating ongoing gentrification forces in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.

9.3.4 
Non-structural responses 
Non-structural responses can include managed retreat and flood forecasting and early-warning systems, along with 
policy measures to support recovery when floods occur. 
Managed Retreat 
Though it is often framed as a single response, managed retreat can be implemented gradually and strategically as 
part of a multidecadal sequence of actions that may include many of the approaches shown in Figure 25, 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
51 
accompanied by iterative community engagement, vulnerability assessments, planning, and equitable compensation 
for those who are eventually resettled (Haasnoot et al., 2021). Managed retreat projects that have been implemented 
across the globe have involved mandatory relocation,  along with projects that are community-supported or 
community-led (Ajibade et al., 2022).  
Strategies used to operationalize managed retreat include voluntary buyouts, restrictions on post-flood rebuilding, 
setbacks of future development from flood hazard areas, conservation easements, and downzoning. Buyouts are a 
common non-structural approach to flood prevention in the United States. In a buyout, property-owners are offered 
compensation for the value of their homes if they relocate (Dundon & Abkowitz, 2021; Mach et al., 2019). A buyout 
requires the government’s willingness to buy a property, and the property owner’s decision to voluntarily move- a 
decision that may be precipitated by a flood. Buyouts may be helpful for homeowners, but do not resolve the hardship 
that flooding poses on renters.  
Following Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, property owners in severely impacted NYC communities were offered 
buyouts through the NYC Build It Back and state-level New York Rising Buyout and Acquisition programs (Binder & 
Greer, 2016; Koslov et al., 2021). Homeowners in central Queens requested buyouts again after the Ida-Remnants 
Cloudburst (Maldonado, 2021). Through PlaNYC, the City is currently working to develop a "blue-sky" program that 
will work with households interested in moving away from high-risk areas, by providing housing/financial counseling 
services to facilitate moving and to minimize long-term displacement from NYC, and then through robust public 
engagement, converting these properties to sustainable/resilient end uses. Buyouts are discussed more fully in 
NPCC4: Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City (Foster et al., 2024). 
Another approach, land swaps, involves owners of flood prone low-lying properties swapping title with the owner of 
less flood prone and typically vacant properties within the same community, typically a government agency. Such 
programs may be spearheaded by residents or led by governmental agencies or non-governmental organizations in 
sustained partnership with community members. However, even when programs are voluntary, residents can feel 
compelled to participate, especially if they lack other means of remaining safely in exposed locations (Yarina et al., 
2019).  
In NYC’s Edgemere neighborhood, pilot land swaps – some of the first to be implemented for FRM anywhere in the 
country - were used to allow property-owners whose homes had been damaged by the storm to exchange their 
property titles for city-owned property with newly constructed homes in the neighborhood that were not located in the 
FEMA SFHA. As part of these efforts, a community-led visioning exercise so that community members could 
determine how to best utilize the undeveloped flood prone properties in a sustainable way that also serves 
longstanding community needs was conducted (Seip, 2022). The original storm-damaged homes were demolished 
and converted into city-owned conserved natural lands. But, ultimately, only three land swaps were successfully 
completed through this program (Spidalieri et al., 2020). 
Application of such strategies can prevent exposure to flood hazards when sea level rise and other climate-related 
changes render other forms of FRM ineffectual. But they can also be fraught with a variety of challenges. (Baja, 2021; 
New et al., 2023; Yarina et al., 2019) Objectors to managed retreat often express concerns about a lack of 
transparency and community participation in decisions regarding when and where governments make this option 
available, a lack of fairness and equity specifically as pertains to community impact in historically marginalized 
communities, and concerns about the fate of ecological resources (Mach & Siders, 2021). Given that all of NYC is 
subject to some kind of flood risk, uniform application of managed retreat would imply abandoning large portions of 
NYC permanently. Advocates suggest that if global climate change continues at its current rate, retreat from low lying 
coastal area “is an inevitable adaptation action,” better planned in advance (Haasnoot et al., 2021). But FRM 
decisions related to flood exposure, it is important to consider potential inequities. While the wealthy may deliberately 
accept flood risks, housing options are often more limited for other groups. Decisions regarding where to discourage 
development and where to protect it are intrinsically related to class, race, and ethnicity (H.-S. Chang et al., 2021; 
Hendricks & Van Zandt, 2021; Kruczkiewicz et al., 2021) and thus directly related to issues of equity. 
Flood forecasting and warning systems 
Flood forecasting and warning systems are also examples of non-structural strategies for FRM. They can provide the 
advanced lead time needed for evacuations, the deployment of active floodproofing barriers, and other emergency 
planning needed to reduce exposure and vulnerability to flooding when a hazard is imminent. Flood forecasting and 
warning systems require accurate forecasts of the extreme meteorological events that can cause flooding, numerical 
models to develop predictions of the extent and magnitude of the resulting flood hazard, and the dissemination of 
warnings in a manner that is accurate, timely, and can support taking protective actions to reduce flood exposure and

 Interim Report for Public Release 
52 
vulnerability (Sadiq et al., 2023). To be useful for risk management, forecasts and warnings must be understood by 
stakeholders and connected to decision processes. As a result, these systems are reliant on both robust social 
science, along with accurate physical forecasts (Uccellini & Ten Hoeve, 2019).  
Key developments in remote-sensing and in-situ observation technologies, data assimilation, and numerical weather 
forecast modeling have enabled advances in the forecasting of many types of weather systems. For example, 
National Hurricane Center forecast errors for Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes have fallen rapidly in 
recent decades, and contemporary 72-hour predictions of hurricane tracks are more accurate than 24-hour forecasts 
were 40 years ago (Alley et al., 2019). There have also been recent improvements in NHC hurricane intensity 
forecasts (Cangialosi et al., 2020). Accurate forecasting of cloudbursts at the longer lead times needed to support 
emergency preparations remain limited, however.  
For the New York City Metropolitan Region, the NWS Weather Forecast Offices release official consensus coastal 
flood forecasts and warnings when a storm threatens. The Stevens Institute of Technology Flood Advisory System 
(SFAS) utilizes ensemble meteorological forecasts and numerical hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling to provides 
accurate predictions of coastal total water levels (Ayyad et al., 2022; Georgas et al., 2016). These time-dependent 
predictions include 5th, 50th and 95th percentile water levels out 4.5 days into the future and are available online where 
users can also sign up for coastal flood warnings and alerts (Stevens Institute of Technology, 2024). These data are 
also shared with NWS, who combine them with NOAA model data for their official forecasts. 
Operational warning systems for urban pluvial flooding remain in development. Recent advances in convection-
permitting numerical weather models and ensemble forecasting make real-time pluvial flood warning systems 
technologically feasible for the first time. (Schubert et al., 2022) developed a flash flood warning system forced by 
Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts. This system was able to forecast High Water Marks (HWMs) with a Mean 
Absolute Error of 2.2ft (0.69m) and to predict flooding distress calls and FEMA damage claims with hit rates of 90% 
and 73%, demonstrating the potential to operationally forecast urban pluvial flooding, but also the need for continued 
research and development. Significant investments in both operational H&H model development and computational 
resources will be needed to increase prediction lead times even to several hours and to reduce the spatial resolution 
of predictions to less than ~4 mi2 (10km2) (L. J. Speight et al., 2021). Once a flood forecast has been generated, 
public alert and warning systems provide information to populations at risk of imminent flood hazards, with the goal of 
“maximizing the probability that people take protective actions and minimize the delay in taking those actions” 
(National Academies of Sciences & Medicine, 2018). Alerts and warnings can be issued by various entities, such as 
local, state, and federal governments, schools, and media stations. These entities can utilize multiple methods to 
send alerts and warnings to the public, including tv/radio broadcast, phone and email technologies and short 
message service (SMS). In addition, social media has emerged as a necessary component for public alert and 
messaging in the last decade (Guillot et al., 2020). For example, in NYC, NotifyNYC is an opt-in emergency public 
communications program available in multiple languages (Notify NYC, 2024).  Participants can register to receive 
alerts about different types of flood-related and other emergencies, through multiple methods of communication such 
as basement-specific preparedness messaging before expected rain events. 
9.3.5 
The need for an integrated response 
As recognized in NPCC4: Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for New York City (Foster et 
al., 2024), the significant linkages that exist between climate risks, adaptation investments, and socioeconomic 
inequality means there is no singular approach to equitable flood resilience that is broadly applicable in NYC. Instead, 
diverse, multiple, and overlapping approaches must be developed with local input crucial in selecting those most 
suitable to the unique context of each exposed community. Most flood resilience researchers, and various Mayor’s 
Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ) policy documents, now advocate initiating the FRM planning 
process by considering a diverse, multifaceted, all-of-the-above approach that is gradually tailored to the 
characteristics, needs, and types of flooding facing each community.  
9.4 
FRM in NYC 
Integrated FRM plans for many NYC neighborhoods could ultimately include some or all of the following components 
(Cea & Costabile, 2022; McClymont et al., 2020; Peck et al., 2022): 
1. 
Non-structural flood-exposure reduction measures – flood exposure reduction measures, flood forecasting 
and early-warning systems, along with policy measures to support recovery when floods occur. 
2. 
Engineered flood protection measures – including both grey and NNBS- designed to prevent flooding from 
occurring in targeted areas. These could include engineered dunes to protect against high tides and surges 
such as have been installed in the Rockaways, as well as features such as the sea walls, levees, and storm 
surge barriers under consideration as part of the NYNJHATS project. Decisions regarding which 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
53 
communities receive engineered flood protection carry significant equity implications and should not be 
based solely on traditional benefit cost ratios that only monetize the value of protected real estate assets. 
The potential for unintended ecological or social consequences (e.g. maladaptation) should also be 
evaluated and mitigated.  
3. 
Leveraged and expanded investments in water quality protection – As mentioned in several places in this 
report, significant investments are being made to improve NYC water quality using both grey and green 
stormwater management practices which, through enhancement and upscaling, could provide some flood 
mitigation. As described above, protocols used to site and design GI currently limit the value of this 
investment for FRM. For GI and other stormwater management practices to be useful in mitigating flooding, 
they need to be implemented across significantly increased areas than required for compliance with clean 
water regulations (Atkins, 2015; Regional Plan Association, 2022). An analysis conducted by the Regional 
Plan Association (2022) asserts that GI application rates in a section of Central Queens would need to be 
40x greater than current levels to fully eliminate flood accumulations of 12 inches or more caused by 3.5 
inches of rain over an hour, and 60x more to fully eliminate flooding. To achieve such higher levels of GI 
application, creative new strategies for resolving a wide range of non-trivial surface (e.g. driveways) and 
subsurface (e.g. infrastructure, utilities, contaminated soils, bedrock, etc.) constraints would need to be 
devised. To date, these types of obstacles have been a major impediment to GI implementation across the 
city (NYC DEP, 2014, 2021). The current GI Program prioritizes watersheds that discharge to waterbodies 
that do not meet their current water use standards. However, as is clear from the City’s Stormwater 
Resiliency maps, pluvial flood hazards are pervasive and GI facilities intended for FRM would need to be 
applied virtually city-wide. If higher GI application rates are accompanied by strategic modifications to GI 
design standards (for example, the use of more hydraulically efficient inlets, deeper surface depressions that 
are directly connected to subsurface vaults and stone reservoirs, etc.), these investments in water quality 
could be integrated into a community’s unique FRM strategy. In communities with high water tables, soils 
with low permeability and/or excessively high percentages of fine particles, and/or shallow bedrock, these 
practices would also likely need to be lined and connected via underdrains to local catchbasins (B. 
Rosenzweig & Fekete, 2018; K. Zhang & Chui, 2019). To overcome the perception that these enhanced GI 
facilities are overdesigned, and to justify the additional costs associated with their construction and 
maintenance, the hybrid role intended for this new generation of GI facilities (i.e. water quality improvement 
and FRM) would need to be recognized formally and encoded in new interagency agreements. Unique and 
unprecedented cost-sharing strategies would also need to be devised, since these practices would provide a 
level of service beyond that needed for Clean Water Act regulatory compliance.  
4. 
Make the City Safe to Flood through an Expanded Cloudburst Program –. In January of 2023, NYC Mayor 
Adams announced $390 million in funding for Cloudburst Resiliency Projects that will include innovative 
plans to detain, retain, and store stormwater in four flood-prone communities in Corona and Kissena Park, 
Queens; Parkchester, Bronx; and East New York, Brooklyn (City of New York Department of Environmental 
Protection, 2023). This program relies heavily on porous pavements, offline storage, and slightly modified 
applications of existing GI designs. The City could decide to expand this program to include a wide range of 
innovative features, such as the Cloudburst Roads, Retention Roads, Retention Spaces, and Green Roads 
currently being implemented in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark (Figure 27). The cloudburst infrastructure 
being implemented in Copenhagen are a form of Resilience FRM and designed to utilize streets and other 
surface features to manage stormwater associated with the very extreme rain events (1% AEP/100-year 
return interval) associated with pluvial flooding (City of Copenhagen, 2012). 
5. 
Structural flood vulnerability mitigation measures – Designs and retrofits such as wet and dry floodproofing 
that reduce the magnitude of the disturbance relative to a threshold, decreasing the consequences of 
flooding in the exposed area. Examples include structural measures such as blowout panels to allow for 
safer egress from basements during floods (FEMA, 2023b). These could also include building codes that 
require elevating utilities, installing pumps, reinforced basement walls and other similar measures, as 
implemented recently in Venice, Italy (Editorial Team, 2019).  
6. 
Non-structural flood vulnerability mitigation measures – flood monitoring and forecasting, early warning 
systems, evacuation and disaster management plans help communities to better understand and prepare for 
flooding. As an example, the city’s expanding network of FloodNet sensors are now being used to record 
high tides, storm surges, and runoff during extreme precipitation events so that this information can be used 
to plan FRM and emergency response (Mydlarz et al., 2024). 
7. 
Flood recovery measures – measures that help to recover and return to normal efficiently after a flood event, 
for example emphasizing reconstruction, rebuilding, compensation, or insurance.

8. 
Transformational strategies– strategies that help a community to learn, adapt, and gradually change to a 
suite of dynamic conditions that determine flood hazard and exposure, while simultaneously addressing 
multiple local needs and challenges 
9. 
Global Knowledge Transfer: Globally, a variety of comprehensive strategies have been developed to 
manage flood risk, and many opportunities for co-learning between NYC and other regions are possible. As 
one example, the European Floods Directive (EFD) (Council of the European Union, 2007) was established 
to reduce the negative consequences of flooding on human health, economic activities, the environment, 
and the cultural heritage of the European Union (EU). This directive requires EU member states to conduct 
risk assessments to identify Areas of Potential Significant Flood Risk (APSFR); followed by mapping of the 
potential consequences of floods of different types and magnitudes; and finally, development of FRM plans 
including specific measures implemented according to the unique hazard and risk characteristics of each 
APSFR.  
10. Leveraging of federal resources: Nationally, FEMA’s recently launched Building Resilient Infrastructure and 
Communities (BRIC) grant program (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 2023) incentivizes 
pre-disaster capacity building, as well as design and management of infrastructure projects, including 
projects incorporating NNBS, that reduce flood risk. Executive Order 14030 reinstates the Federal Flood 
Risk Management Standard that requires agencies to prepare for and protect federally funded buildings and 
projects from flood risks (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 2022). The Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law included $50 billion to help communities protect against multiple hazards including floods. 
Some of these FRM components are already built into local FRM plans and policies. The Lower Manhattan Coastal 
Resilience and the East Side Coastal Resiliency Projects both aim to reduce coastal flood risks in individual 
neighborhoods of Manhattan. The City of New York’s Climate Resilience Design Guidelines (2022a) provide 
guidance on how to reduce the impacts of extreme precipitation, sea level rise, and heat on capital projects (e.g., 
infrastructure, landscapes, and buildings). These guidelines focus on reducing stormwater inputs to the city’s sewer 
system and selecting appropriate design flood elevations for Capital projects located in current and future coastal 
floodplains. In its Neighborhood Coastal Flood Protection Project Planning Guidance, the City of New York (2021) 
provided guidance for initial concept planning, feasibility and design stages of neighborhood scale coastal flood 
protection projects that are equitable, resilient, and well designed. This guidance underscores the importance of 
shaping these projects to address unique neighborhood characteristics, maximize community benefits and improve 
the public realm.  In its long-term vision for Increasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change, 
NYCDEP (New York City Department of Environmental Protection, 2021) describes a multi-faceted approach which 
will involve some upscaling its implementation of rain gardens, stormwater medians, onsite detention projects, green 
roofs, Bluebelts, and cloudburst projects to augment drainage capacity while providing valuable community co-
benefits. The Vision also includes interim measures that will improve communication between residents and the City, 
better maintain existing drainage infrastructure, and better predict where flooding occurs now and in the future. It is 
noteworthy, however, that these measures do not explicitly address the need to manage higher volumes and 
intensities of stormwater (e.g. contemporary 100-year or greater rain events), protect the coast, reduce groundwater 
flooding, or build resilience to compound-hazards. 
To date, no community-initiated FRM plans have been developed in NYC. However, while none of the case studies 
reviewed in the Equity Chapter mention the development of any community-scale FRM plans, other community-scale 
resiliency planning efforts that emphasize anti-displacement, and a just energy transition are underway, as profiled on 
the Regional Plan Association’s recently launched NYC Climate Resilience Plan Mapper (Regional Plan Association, 
2023). PlaNYC and Mayor Adams’ Climate Strong Communities program will leverage resources to build climate 
resilience in communities that did not receive Post-Sandy relief funds (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & 
Environmental Justice, 2022b; City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023). Examples of individual properties that 
have developed site-scale FRM plans can also be found throughout the city.

Figure 27: Cloudburst roads (starting upper left) are designed to convey runoff generated during extreme events on the surface to 
places where that can flood safely. Elevated curbs, recontoured street cross sections, and slightly depressed intersections are used 
to direct the flood waters. Retention roads (second down, left) are designed to retain and detain flood waters in subgrade cisterns, 
vaults, and curbside planters integrated into the right-of-way. This approach is similar to NYCDEP’s current Cloudburst standards. 
Retention spaces (third down, left) retain and store floodwater in multifunctional urban spaces such as depressed parking areas, 
squares, gardens, and recreational fields. Examples from Copenhagen, Denmark: Tåsinge Plads (1), Scandiagade (2-4), and 
Enghavepark (5). Finally, Green roads (bottom, left) are designed to remove and retain water on smaller roads and alleys. Photos 1-

10 Opportunities for Future Research 
Though recent City guidelines and vision documents are important and impactful, much more applied research is 
needed to reduce flood risks and build flood resilience in NYC. Several key opportunities for future research are 
summarized below: 
 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
56 
10.1 Continue to monitor, model, and map all flood hazards, and their interactions, 
across NYC 
Through a collaboration between the city and academic partners known as FloodNet, the City will be deploying a total 
of 500 ultrasonic surface flood depth sensors around the City by mid-2027 (City of New York et al., 2024). These 
sensors will be helpful in flood response, namely by quantifying the real-time depth and duration of different types of 
flooding. These sensors can also be helpful in calibrating and validating hydrologic and hydraulic models to historic 
flood events captured by the sensors, improving model confidence for use in simulating current and future flood 
hazards. Ideally, the FloodNet sensors will be accompanied by other data acquisition initiatives as described below: 
■ 
More precipitation gauges that record precipitation accumulations at subhourly temporal resolution. 
o 
More spatially explicit, sub-hourly precipitation data are needed to better map spatial variability in 
extreme precipitation and to drive real-time simulation of pluvial flood hazards. To support FRM, 
these observations must be accessible to the research and engineering consulting communities, 
and the data must be quality controlled. The integration of precipitation observations with 
community science programs could enhance community understanding of extreme precipitation, 
climate change, flooding, and FRM, ultimately leading to social transformation. 
■ 
More water level and flow gauges throughout the harbor and in local rivers, creeks, and sewers. 
o 
If planned along with the precipitation gauges and co-located near the FloodNet sensors 
(applicable for in-sewer gauges), this water level and flow data would improve the accuracy of 
hydrologic, hydraulic, and hydrodynamic modeling, improving our ability to simulate sewer flows, 
coastal and fluvial flood risks, and estuarine water quality, supporting flood preparation and 
ecological transformation. It could also help to design flood-risk prevention and flood protection 
measures in coastal or fluvial floodplains. Stevens Institute has maintained 12 water level gauges 
in the harbor region for the Port Authority since 2015. Data can be visualized online alongside 
forecasts (http;//stevens.edu/SFAS) but aren’t available for download.  
o 
If these gauges were maintained by governmental agencies like NOAA and USGS, working in 
close collaboration with NYCDEP, community scientists, fishers, and community-based 
organizations, they could also help advance social transformation. 
■ 
More groundwater monitoring wells instrumented with water level loggers and salinity/conductivity probes. 
o 
Positioned near the coasts and in topographic depressions, these data could help to improve our 
understanding of groundwater levels and groundwater flow directions, as well as quantify the 
extent saltwater intrusion into coastal artesian aquifers. In this way the data would help to design 
groundwater Flood-Risk prevention and Flood Protection measures. 
■ 
Digitize the geotechnical test results conducted by City as part of its Green Infrastructure Program. 
o 
The City has invested millions of dollars in geotechnical testing to support its evolving Green 
Infrastructure program. This data includes depth stratified soil texture analysis, and critical 
information regarding depth to groundwater and depth to bedrock. If this data were digitized, 
georeferenced, and made open source, it could be helpful in improving groundwater modeling 
throughout the city. 
o 
Along with the additional groundwater depth data described above, this geotechnical information 
could also help to identify subsurface infrastructure and subgrade spaces vulnerable to 
groundwater flooding, promoting Flood Preparation, and could also help to design appropriate 
Flood Protection measures. 
The proposed new data sets could help to improve the City’s ability to model pluvial, fluvial, coastal, and groundwater 
flood hazards. Key to this initiative is a commitment to perpetual data collection at consistent locations, facilitating 
retrospective analysis of historical trends and helping ensure that the most extreme flooding events are captured for 
model calibration. Sustained procurement of high-quality and high spatial and temporal resolution data will build a 
strong flood-related data repository, ensuring the City can leverage the most recent and future advancements in data-
intensive technology (e.g. digital twins and AI).

Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
57 
It is also recommended that the City continue to integrate and develop high resolution models that can be used to 
simulate coastal hydrodynamics, sewer, surface, and groundwater flows in the same modeling platform. For water 
quality improvement purposes, NYCDEP uses an ensemble of 1D hydrologic and hydraulic models to simulate 
separate and combined sewer flows through its major trunk sewers. Development of the recently released 
Stormwater Resiliency Maps required enhancing portions of these 1D models with higher resolution representation of 
various elements of the drainage system. The Stormwater Resiliency Study also coupled the 1D model to a 2D model 
representation of the surface, enabling “rain-on-grid” simulation of pluvial flood patterns. In partnership with NYCDEP, 
the USGS is developing a transient numerical model of water table response to sea level rise in Queens and Staten 
Island. The accuracy of these early attempts at model integration could be improved by creating higher resolution 
data such as digital elevation models, land use cover maps, and other digital representations of the built environment. 
Integrated modeling can provide more detailed and site-specific results but will require significantly higher computing 
power. Use of cloud-based computing technology would reduce computation time and facilitate assessment of long-
term historical data (requires a substantial simulation period) and near real-time warning systems (requires near-
instantaneous model results to issue warnings). Cloud computing may also improve modeling of interacting, 
compound flood risks across integrated modeling platforms.  
Recent statistical and probabilistic assessments of rain and storm surge (See Section 8.1) (Z. Chen et al., in 
Preparation) demonstrate that co-occurrence of these flood drivers can occur during extreme storm events. However, 
an important next step will be to simulate these scenarios in flood models such as those described above. Given the 
availability of one or more such flood models, it is recommended that an assessment of actual compound flood risk is 
initiated. 
10.2 Continue to develop flood vulnerability indices like the FSHRI, which can be 
used to support the equitable allocation of resources for flood risk management 
in priority neighborhoods 
As described throughout this chapter, NYC is subject to different flood hazards, each with a unique geography of 
exposure. Flood hazard geographies are expected to expand in the future as the climate changes. When integrated 
with or overlayed on top of flood hazard maps, the recently developed Flood Susceptibility to Harm and Recovery 
Index is an important first step in identifying neighborhoods and populations with greatest need for resources to 
support FRM. The maps published in this chapter represent an initial attempt to map social vulnerability in areas 
exposed to flooding where specific hazards have been mapped. Future work could identify socially vulnerable 
neighborhoods that are exposed to a broader range of types and magnitudes of flooding, including compound flood 
hazards which have not yet been comprehensively modeled. Additional research could also examine vertical 
differences in flood vulnerability focusing on residents of multistory buildings. Although many types of flooding have 
historically been analyzed separately, there are many advantages to holistically analyzing all types of floods within 
the same modeling domain, including coastal, pluvial, fluvial, and groundwater hazards.  
Along with socioeconomic factors, infrastructure and the built environment features are important contributors to flood 
vulnerability that should be evaluated in future flood vulnerability assessment. In this report, we provide an 
assessment of exposed buildings with known infrastructure vulnerabilities to flooding that could be mapped using 
available geospatial data. These included 1-2 unit residential buildings with basements and other subgrade spaces. 
However, other datasets that would support a more comprehensive assessment of infrastructure vulnerability are 
currently unavailable. Examples include: 
■ 
Citywide data on the elevation of critical building utilities (e.g. boilers, electrical systems) 
■ 
Citywide data on with/without wet- and dry-floodproofing features 
Efforts to develop these data would provide a valuable opportunity to enhance flood vulnerability assessment 
research. 
10.3 Grant decision-making power and resources to non-governmental stakeholders 
to develop community-driven FRM plans at the neighborhood and/or landscape 
scale 
In NPCC3 Foster et al (2019) reported that representatives of the city’s most socially vulnerable communities desire a 
deeper engagement in climate planning via collaborative co-productive planning processes. However, in the United 
States, formal responsibility for FRM is distributed across various levels of government from the Federal government 
to the states, down to the City, and it can be institutionally complex for governmental stakeholders to relinquish 
meaningful decision-making roles to non-governmental flooding stakeholders. That said, many strategies for 
meaningful engagement of community stakeholders in climate decisions have been implemented in different places. 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
58 
To scale-up adaptation efforts and build capacity among multiple stakeholder groups, the Urban Climate Change 
Research Network has hosted Urban Design Climate Workshops in Paris, Naples, Durban, and NYC (Urban Climate 
Change Research Network (UCCRN), 2023). In a study of alternative strategies for implementing green infrastructure 
in the Bronx, Wong and Montalto (2020) demonstrate how incorporation of surveyed community preferences in GI 
siting decisions can bring about greater long term economic and social impact from the City’s GI program. In the 
recent NYC Climate Adaptation Scenarios workshop series (Balk et al., 2024; E. Cook et al., 2022), participants co-
imagined scenarios through which NYC residents, provided adequate information and infrastructure, become resilient 
to extreme precipitation as they self-organize into community land trusts that manage locally generated stormwater in 
innovative ways.  
Multi-stakeholder participation in FRM poses some challenges, such as the possibility of differences of perception 
and/or conflicts among different stakeholder groups, including both governmental and non-governmental entities, 
each of whom have different perceptions, knowledge, values, and needs; and the possibility that ideas that emerge 
from a deliberative process might be logistically complex to implement. Co-development of FRM plans requires 
investment of adequate time and resources (Almoradie et al., 2015; Maskrey et al., 2022). A broad array of 
stakeholders should be engaged early in the FRM planning process (Ceccato et al., 2011; Sahin & Mohamed, 2013), 
with open communication allowing stakeholders to express differing views and opinions, and collaborative technology 
such as remote conferencing tools and online collaboration platforms used throughout the process (Almoradie et al., 
2015). Regular meetings, training sessions, and awareness-raising campaigns can be organized to co-develop goals, 
concepts, and decision-making frameworks, build capacity, reduce conflicts, and promote mutual understanding 
(Ceccato et al., 2011; Estoque et al., 2022; Maskrey et al., 2022; Pagano et al., 2019).  
Such methods can be used to engage flooding stakeholders in key decisions regarding equity in FRM, including: 
■ 
How are community stakeholders engaged in decisions around flood prevention and protection? 
■ 
How will prevention and protection measures change access to, and cultural relevance of, flood hazard areas?  
■ 
How does flood prevention influence destination communities and receiving locations?  
■ 
Do community stakeholders have the means and capacities to maintain flood-risk reduction measures over 
time? 
■ 
How does prioritization of protection vary across communities?  
■ 
Which groups are most likely to experience losses or disruptions as a result of a particular kind of flood?  
■ 
How can resources be allocated to minimize transboundary risks? What additional resources are necessary to 
protect neighboring communities? 
10.4 Develop incentives, policies, and enable comprehensive transformations of the 
city emphasizing long-term flood resilience, sustainability, and equity, 
highlighting the role of NNBS 
■ 
Flood risk prevention, protection, mitigation, and preparedness measures can help to reduce near term flood 
vulnerability. Due to its role in changing precipitation patterns and raising sea levels, climate change 
contributes to NYC’s current and hazards and will further increase NYC’s future flood hazards in the absence 
of rapidly-initiated global reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. However, as described throughout this 
report, flood risk is also determined by the extent to which the city’s human population and its ecosystems are 
exposed and vulnerable to flood hazards. Exposure and vulnerability, in turn, are the result of land use, 
infrastructure, and social policies that dramatically transformed the ecology of NYC. Urgent, citywide 
transformation of these systems will be needed to manage future flood risks if global climate change is allowed 
to continue unabated. These transformations must include both ecological restoration and restorative social

Key Message 1  
NYC faces risks from four types of flood hazards: pluvial, fluvial, coastal, and 
groundwater, each with a unique geography of exposure that will expand in 
different ways in the future due to climate change. Identifying these four types 
as separate, but related, hazards is an important step in studying how they 
impact NYC, what FRM tools are available to address them, and where future 
research is needed. Climate adaptation planning must consider all four of 
these types of flood hazard and their potential impacts across a range of 
magnitudes, including very extreme events. 
Description of Evidence 
The risks associated with coastal and fluvial flooding have been evaluated 
through Flood Insurance Studies by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA, 2007, 2013). Projections of sea level rise with climate change 
and its impacts on coastal flooding have also been evaluated in previous 
NPCC reports (González, Ortiz, Smith, Devineni, Colle, Booth, Ravindranath, 
Rivera, Horton, & Towey, 2019; P. Orton et al., 2019b). Projections of 
amplified precipitation due to climate are provided in Ortiz et al. (2024). In this 
assessment, we also conduct a review of the scientific literature, technical 
reports, and government agency databases on risks associated with pluvial 
and groundwater flooding. 
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Significant uncertainties remain regarding the risks of associated flood hazard 
types that have not yet been mapped (e.g. fast-moving water, daytime and 
residential exposure of populations at the spatial scales relevant to flooding in 
New York City, and the tangible and intangible cost of flooding when it occurs. 
 
There are also high remaining uncertainties on how climate change will 
impact short-duration, intense rainfall events associated with pluvial and 
fluvial flooding. These uncertainties are discussed in Braneon et al (2024) and 
Ortiz et al (2024). In addition, observations of shallow groundwater levels in 
Brooklyn and Queens are available through 2012, but continuous 
observations along the coast are not available to allow for an analysis of 
trends with sea level rise. There is also very limited observational data 
available on aquifer properties and shallow groundwater levels in Manhattan, 
The Bronx, and Staten Island. 
 
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Based on the available evidence and the authors’ expert judgement, there is 
high confidence that pluvial and fluvial flooding will increase due to climate 
change if flood hazard mitigation efforts are not implemented. Given the 
trajectory and projections of sea level rise, it is virtually certain that coastal 
flooding will increase. 
 
Confidence on both the magnitude, spatial distribution, and timing of the 
groundwater table rise in response to sea level response – and resulting 
groundwater flooding in the absence of mitigation efforts – remains very low. 
 
Key Message 2 
Discussions about flooding often focus on risks within the Special Flood 
Hazard Areas (SFHA) mapped by the United States Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA). However, the FEMA SFHA maps present 
fluvial and coastal flood hazards only. The recently released NYC Stormwater 
Flood Maps represent the city’s first attempt to map pluvial and some 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
60 
compound flood hazard with risks spread out over a much larger fraction of 
NYC. In this chapter, we present a preliminary assessment of pluvial and 
groundwater flood hazard exposure areas that can be utilized to support FRM. 
Additional research is necessary to develop hazard maps that represent a 
broader range of flooding hazards and their increase in magnitude in 
response to anthropogenic climate change. 
 
Description of Evidence 
The assessment of building exposure to flooding was conducted through 
overlay analysis of existing flood hazard  (City of New York Mayor’s Office of 
Resiliency, 2021; FEMA, 2013) and depth-to-water table (Monti, 2013) layers 
with geospatial datasets on the location of building footprints (NYC OTI, 
2023), NYCHA Public Housing Development Map Data (NYC OTI, 2020), and 
a one-time data layer of Building Elevation and Subgrade Spaces in February, 
2022 (NYC DCP, 2013). Analyses were conducted using Python 3 and QGIS 
3.22 software.   
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
In this assessment we provide new information on the exposure of two types 
of buildings associated with increased vulnerability: New York City Housing 
Authority (NYCHA) residences and 1-2 family residential buildings with 
basements or other subgrade space. Uncertainties associated with each data 
layer used in the exposure assessment are described in their respective 
sources. 
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Confidence is high in the overall trends exhibited by the H&H models used to 
map pluvial flooding exposure, showing that more intense rainfall will produce 
more flooding because the drainage system is not sized to convey the return 
period events that were simulated. Confidence is medium regarding the exact 
extents and depths of predicted flooding at the street/property-scale due to 
stated model resolution. 
The water table elevation map for Brooklyn and Queens used to map potential 
groundwater flooding exposure was developed through a synoptic survey of 
observational and supply wells across Long Island conducted by the USGS in 
2012 (Monti et al., 2013b).  Depth to water estimates were developed using 
this layer and a Digital Elevation Model created by NOAA and the USGS 
through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013.  The resulting Depth to 
Water Layer has a vertical accuracy of 10 feet (Como et al., 2018).  While 
confidence in the overall spatial patterns provided by this layer is high, this 
layer may not represent finer-scale variation in the water table or changes that 
may have occurred since 2012. Groundwater data in Manhattan, The Bronx 
and Staten Island remains very limited, and no depth-to-water table layer is 
currently available for these boroughs.  
Key Message 3 
Much of NYC is exposed to pluvial flooding, which occurs when the intensity 
of precipitation exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil and the hydraulic 
capacity of the sewer system. These conditions often occur during cloudbusts, 
short-duration periods of intense rainfall that can be embedded within large 
storm systems or occur as individual, hard-to-forecast thunderstorms. Intense 
rainfall has already been observed to have become more frequent in NYC 
since the mid-20th century and are projected to further intensify and occur 
more frequently with unmitigated climate change. Despite the increasing risk, 
pluvial flood hazards remain poorly understood.  The NYC Floodnet project is 
beginning to collect observations of flooding when it occurs, but more 
monitoring of rainfall, in-sewer flows, and flooding, along with Hydrologic and 
Hydraulic (H&H) modeling of pluvial flooding processes and impacts are 
needed. 
Description of Evidence 
In this assessment we utilize the outputs of H&H modeling (City of New York 
Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021) to evaluate the areal extent of potential 
New York City Panel on Climate Chage 4th Assessment 
Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
61 
pluvial flooding in New York City during moderate and extreme rain events. 
311 service requests were used to map the locations across the city where 
community members have been impacted by street flooding during intense 
rain events. Narrative data provided through the National Center for 
Environmental Information’s (NCEI) Storm Events Database and Storm Data 
publication also provide insight on severe impacts of historical pluvial flooding 
across the city and their associated meteorological conditions. 
Future precipitation projections are based on the mean citywide delta change 
factors derived from on an ensemble of climate models using the LOCA2 
downscaling method for SSP245 (mid-century greenhouse emissions 
reduction) and SSP585 (unmitigated climate change). These analyses are 
described in McPhearson et al. (2024). 
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
In this assessment, we provide a literature review on impactful pluvial flooding 
in NYC, and an exposure assessment of vulnerable buildings to pluvial 
flooding. While there are multiple mechanisms through which climate change 
can increase the intensity of cloudburst events in NYC, these processes 
remain poorly represented in global-scale numerical models used to develop 
climate projections. 
We also provide a detailed case study of a cloudburst associated with the 
remnants of Hurricane Ida in 2021, which resulted in 13 direct fatalities, 
severe disruptions, and extensive damage in many parts of the city. This case 
study includes a literature review, an assessment of rainfall rates and return 
intervals associated with this event, and mapping of 311 service requests of 
street flooding and other flood-associated complaints. Attribution studies 
focused on this, and similar events, are needed to determine the role that 
climate change may have had in setting it up and whether more events of 
similar intensity and spatial extent will occur in NYC in the future. 
Significant uncertainties remain in quantitative projections for extreme 
precipitation since the processes associated with short-duration intense 
precipitation events remain poorly represented in the global-scale numerical 
models used to develop climate projections (Fowler, Ali, Allan, Ban, Barbero, 
Berg, Blenkinsop, Cabi, Chan, Dale, et al., 2021). Significant uncertainties 
also remain regarding rainfall intensity and areal extent thresholds for pluvial 
flooding and with hazards associated with pluvial flooding such as fast-flowing 
water and exposure to pathogens.  
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Based on the available evidence in the scientific literature and the authors' 
expert judgement, there is high confidence that short-duration, intense 
precipitation events will continue to increase in frequency and magnitude in 
the absence of rapid mitigation of global climate change. As a result, pluvial 
flooding will occur more frequently due to climate change if flood hazard 
mitigation efforts are not implemented. 
At the same time, there is only medium confidence in the quantitative 
projections of these increases, due to remaining uncertainties in the 
representation of short-duration precipitation processes in global climate 
models.  
Key Message 4 
In NYC, fluvial flood risks are spatially localized to areas of the Bronx and 
Staten Island where surface stream channels remain. In the remainder of the 
city, historical surface streams were filled and replaced, with their flow routed 
to the sewer system.  As a result, fluvial flood hazard has largely been 
replaced by pluvial flood hazard in most of the city. Both fluvial and pluvial 
flood hazards will increase due to climate-change driven intensification of 
precipitation and elevation of sea level. While traditional floodplain 
management can be an effective strategy in reducing exposure to fluvial

62 
floods, a broader, watershed-scale approach that retains, detains, and 
redirects stormwater is needed to jointly manage pluvial and fluvial flood risks. 
Description of Evidence 
The locations of remaining inland streams and rivers in New York City were 
assessed in the FEMA 2013 Flood Insurance Study (FEMA, 2013). 
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
There are high remaining uncertainties on how climate change will impact 
short-duration, intense rainfall events associated with pluvial and fluvial 
flooding. These uncertainties are discussed in Braneon et al (2024) and Ortiz 
et al (2024). 
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Based on the available evidence and the authors’ expert judgement, there is 
high confidence that fluvial flooding will increase along with pluvial flooding 
due to climate change if flood hazard mitigation efforts are not implemented. 
Key Message 5 
Current and future coastal flood risks are caused by high storm tides, rising 
sea levels, and historical development on landfill over tidal marshes and 
nearshore areas. In Jamaica Bay, tides and storm surges have also been 
significantly elevated by historical dredging and landfilling, worsening chronic 
and extreme flooding. On December 23rd, 2022, a major flood event around 
Jamaica Bay was caused, in part, by dredging that has led to amplified storm 
tides which were nearly a foot higher there than elsewhere in the harbor. 
Further improvement of our understanding of future coastal flood hazard is 
possible through downscaling of climate model data and modeling of multiple 
compounding flood drivers. 
Description of Evidence 
Recent research has demonstrated that Jamaica Bay landscape changes 
have made tides larger and worsened storm tides, playing a similar role to 
past sea level rise in worsening flooding (P. M. Orton, Sanderson, et al., 2020; 
Pareja‐Roman et al., 2023). 
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Important remaining uncertainties for coastal flood hazard are baseline storm 
climatology and climate change effects on storms. Also, a case is made 
(Section 6.4) that coastal storm surge models used for risk assessment and 
forecasting may have inaccuracies due to the challenge of simulating flow 
through the narrow and sharply curving areas of East River. 
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is very high confidence that sea level rise will continue to worsen 
monthly and extreme coastal flooding, but large uncertainties remain in the 
exact amounts, as reflected in NPCC projections. Confidence is high that 
landscape change has worsened flooding for Jamaica Bay, given that the 
finding is based both on contrasting models and observations from the 1870s 
and modern era. Confidence is low in the effects of future storm changes on 
coastal flooding.  
Key Message 6 
Many NYC neighborhoods have very shallow groundwater tables and already 
experience groundwater flooding. These areas include parts of the city that 
were developed when groundwater levels were substantially lower due to 
historical pumping of groundwater for municipal water supply. Groundwater 
flood risk has the potential to be particularly significant in NYC because of the 
prevalence of subterranean infrastructure. Groundwater flood hazards have 
not yet been assessed citywide, but preliminary efforts are underway. Sea 
level rise may cause groundwater levels to rise, resulting in inflow and 
infiltration of groundwater into sewer pipes and subterranean spaces and 
inundation of topographically vulnerable locations from below. Improved 
characterization of spatially heterogenous aquifer hydraulic properties and 
sustained monitoring of ground water levels will be necessary to develop 
projections for future groundwater flooding.

Climate Change and New York City’s Flood Risk 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
63 
Description of Evidence 
Observations of shallow groundwater levels in Brooklyn and Queens are 
available through 2012, but continuous observations along the coast are not 
available to allow for an analysis of trends with sea level rise. There is also 
very limited observational data available on aquifer properties and shallow 
groundwater levels in Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island so exposure 
assessment could not be conducted for these boroughs. 
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
There are remaining uncertainties about the rate of sea level rise and 
substantial remaining uncertainties associated with the hydrogeology of 
NYC’s complex subsurface, both which will determine the transient response 
of the groundwater table to sea level rise.  There are also remaining 
uncertainties associated with the rate and distribution of groundwater pumping 
to dewater subgrade spaces and tunnels and its potential impacts on the 
water table and receiving water quality.  
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Confidence on both the magnitude, spatial distribution, and timing of the 
groundwater table rise in response to sea level response – and resulting 
groundwater flooding in the absence of mitigation efforts – remains very low. 
Key Message 7 
Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme precipitation events 
and elevating sea levels, increasing the likelihood of compounding of either 
one of these flood drivers by the other. In addition, tropical and post-tropical 
cyclones (TCs) have caused severe storm surges and extreme rainfall to 
occur simultaneously. While assessment is limited by the small number of 
historical TC events, the limited evidence suggests that TCs can cause low-
probability, dangerous compound flooding. Given the importance of TCs and 
limited historical data, a deeper understanding of compound flood hazard 
likely requires detailed modeling and downscaling to simulate such storms 
under the present and future climate. 
Description of Evidence 
Sea levels have risen 1.5 feet since 1860 and are accelerating, with 
projections of 25-65 inches by 2100 (~2 to ~5.5 feet; 80% confidence range 
(Braneon et al., 2024). Significant increases have been observed in the 
frequency of extreme (95th and 99th percentile) rain events and in the 
magnitude of all rain events in the New York City Metropolitan Area since the 
mid 20th century (Braneon et al., 2024). Further increases are projected 
through the 21st Century (Braneon et al., 2024)These separate changes alone 
can increase the potential for compound flooding.  
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Analyses of historical data under the Climate VIA project (Section 8) have 
quantified the baseline present-day flood hazard from co-occurrence of rain 
and storm surge. The research focused on simultaneous and near-
simultaneous rain and storm surge through analysis of hourly historical data 
because NYC is located on several small, heavily urbanized watersheds, 
where timescales of drainage are short, and rain and surge must be nearly 
simultaneous to cause compounding. The results reveal non-zero correlations 
between rain and storm surge and that there is a higher probability of one 
variable being extreme when the other is extreme. For all storm type data 
merged together, rain and surge have a low, but non-zero rank correlation. 
However, for TC data alone, their correlation can be high. In addition, when 
one of the two flood drivers is extreme (the “primary” driver), the magnitude of 
the secondary flood driver during TCs is much higher than for other storm 
types. 
More comprehensive research on all flood hazard types, including 
groundwater and Bronx River-fluvial compound flooding is needed. While 
most research to date has focused on less-frequent, extreme compound 
events, more research on the chronic flooding that will result from more-
frequently occurring high tides and the infiltration of groundwater into storm 
drains sewers is needed for NYC. Also, a critical next step will be compound 
flood modeling and analyses of street flood observations alongside the results

64 
of statistical assessments like those summarized above, to translate these 
data into an understanding of actual on-the-ground impacts; two drivers can 
co-occur, but their combined flood depth is often less than their sum. 
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
The limited historical record of TCs affecting NYC limits our confidence in 
NYCs potential for joint occurrences of heavy or extreme rain and surge, 
which we understand with medium confidence. We have high confidence that 
there will be increased chronic compound flooding from rainfall and higher sea 
levels unless flood mitigation efforts are undertaken. 
Key Message 8 
NYC’s NNBS provide many valuable ecosystem services, including critical 
water regulation services that can play a role in FRM. However, many of 
these systems are themselves vulnerable to  different flood hazards, 
especially along the coast. Research into how different types of NNBS are 
impacted by flood/storm surge events, hydroperiod changes, rising water 
tables and salinization is needed to better evaluate future changes in 
ecosystem services. Opportunities for designing NNBS to mitigate the impacts 
of various flood hazards need to be further explored. 
Description of Evidence 
Intensive development of NYC has significantly reduced the area and 
functionality of its natural systems, replacing them with developed surfaces. 
Research into the impact of climate change on natural systems is underway in 
NYC and throughout the region but more work is needed to examine how 
specific changes are impacting specific systems and what can be done to 
mitigate negative impacts. 
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
More research is needed to understand how NNBS respond to climatic 
changes including changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and tidal 
flood frequency. 
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
We have great confidence that climate change and historical development 
has negatively impacted natural systems. 
Key Message 9 
Comprehensive FRM plans must be designed to address the full range of 
flood hazards faced by individual communities. Planning must begin with 
participatory decision-making processes that establish neighborhood-specific 
levels of acceptable future flood risk. To reduce risks from current levels, FRM 
tailored to each community will include combinations of structural and non-
structural approaches, including NNBS, that are implemented in ways that 
reduce social vulnerability and are also synergistic with community histories, 
needs, and goals. 
Description of Evidence 
A large body of research has been published recently on FRM locally, 
nationally, and internationally. This research includes peer-reviewed journal 
papers, grey literature, and practitioner reports focusing on the physical 
effectiveness of these responses and the logistical, governance, and 
socioeconomic factors that constrain their implementation.  
New Information and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Much of the research on FRM is nascent. Very few long-term studies exist.  
Assessment of Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
We are very confident that successful FRM strategies will both respond to the 
unique set of local flood risks and be synergistic with community needs.

12 Sustained Assessment 
NYC’s flood risks vary across the four types of flooding presented herein and in the ways in which they may 
compound. Moreover, these risks require watershed-scale understanding of stormwater for pluvial and fluvial flood 
risks, improved characterization of, and monitoring of groundwater levels and potential for future groundwater 
flooding, and more holistic approaches to capture coastal flooding impacts alongside more comprehensive 
understanding of existing systemic adaptive capacities.  
While NYC’s NNBS provide many valuable ecosystem services, they too are at risk, especially along the coast, and 
so researching how different types of NNBS are impacted by flood/storm surge events, hydroperiod changes, rising 
water tables and salinization is needed to better evaluate ecosystem services. Given increasing opportunities to work 
with NNBS to reduce risks while improving NY’s public realm, understanding how such systems might adapt given 
expected climate changes and how to build into such systems more adaptive capacity remains an ongoing area of 
research.  
Beyond the technical analyses needed, sustained assessment offers New Yorkers the opportunity to deepen their 
understanding of NYC’s flood risks while simultaneously improving individual and organizational capacities to address 
those risks. While technical experts continue risk assessments, broader collaborations between governmental, 
institutional, business, and community-based organizations could help NYers to better understand these risks and the 
implications to the households and economies of New York.  
Future assessments could consider how recently launched activities, such as Rainproof NY or the Climate 
Knowledge Exchange Flood Series, improve community awareness of the ability to cope with, and the opportunities 
to adapt to, these risks. Moreover, these could be further leveraged to couple technical analyses and community 
preparedness in mutually supportive ways wherein community readiness becomes a recognized criterion, particularly 
for communities where planned investments in flood risk reduction measures are underway or are in planning.  
Recognizing that sustained assessment sets the stage for ongoing dialogue within these communities and across 
various groups of stakeholders while also emphasizing shared growth, setting agenda specific to sustained 
assessment and NYC’s flood risks could enable a whole of community approach, similar to the approaches well 
underway in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.

and pluvial flooding resulting from ~3.5-inches of rain per hour with 58-inches of sea level rise (right). Areas where 
inland streams and coastal wetlands were landfilled for urban development tend now to be topographically low-
elevation areas that are exposed to flooding.  Areas landfilled to dispose of municipal waste and dredged sediment 
are now anomalously higher-elevation areas, even when located along the coast. The map of historic streams and 
wetlands was provided by Eric Sanderson and Lucinda Royte, New York Botanical Garden. ....................................... 7

Figure 6: Hourly (black bars) and cumulative precipitation during the Ida-Remnants Cloudburst on September 1, 2021 
(EDT) Cumulative precipitation was determined using 1-minute ASOS observations (blue lines). 1-minute data was 
not transmitted from the Central Park Station during this event. Cumulative precipitation was calculated based on 
hourly measurements (black dotted line) for that station. One minute data allows for evaluation of extreme 
accumulations that do not correspond with hourly measurement intervals. For example, 3.76 inches of rain fell in the 
60-minute period between 21:18 and 22:18 at LaGuardia Airport. Graphic by BR Rosenzweig. ................................. 19 
Figure 7: 83 high water marks (HWM) such as seed lines, mud, and debris were surveyed by the US Geological 
Survey in the weeks following the Ida-Remnants Cloudburst.((Finkelstein et al., 2023) Using these observations, land 
surface inundation was estimated within an 820.2 ft (250m) buffer of each observed HWMs. During the Ida 
cloudburst, deep inundation from pluvial flooding occurred in areas that were far from the water bodies used as the 
basis of FEMA SFHA modeling  Flooding from this event was not limited to areas where HWMs were obtained, and 
also occurred in areas of the city that were not surveyed or where HWMs could not be identified. Several inundated 
areas are highlighted here and all HWM data from this survey can be viewed at:

Figure 27: Cloudburst roads (starting upper left) are designed to convey runoff generated during extreme events on 
the surface to places where that can flood safely. Elevated curbs, recontoured street cross sections, and slightly 
depressed intersections are used to direct the flood waters. Retention roads (second down, left) are designed to 
retain and detain flood waters in subgrade cisterns, vaults, and curbside planters integrated into the right-of-way. This 
approach is similar to NYCDEP’s current Cloudburst standards. Retention spaces (third down, left) retain and store 
floodwater in multifunctional urban spaces such as depressed parking areas, squares, gardens, and recreational 
fields. Examples from Copenhagen, Denmark: Tåsinge Plads (1), Scandiagade (2-4), and Enghavepark (5). Finally, 
Green roads (bottom, left) are designed to remove and retain water on smaller roads and alleys. Photos 1-4 courtesy

Abstract: 
This chapter of the New York City Panel on Climate Change 4 (NPCC4) report considers climate health risks, 
vulnerabilities, and resilience strategies in New York City’s unique urban context. It updates evidence since the last 
health assessment in 2015 as part of NPCC2 and addresses climate health risks and vulnerabilities that have 
emerged as especially salient to NYC since 2015. Climate health risks from heat and flooding are emphasized. In 
addition, other climate-sensitive exposures harmful to human health are considered, including outdoor and indoor air 
pollution, including aero-allergens; insect vectors of human illness; waterborne infectious and chemical contaminants; 
and compounding of climate health risks with other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Evidence-informed strategies for reducing future climate risks to health are considered.

1 Chapter Summary  
This chapter considers climate health risks, vulnerabilities, and resilience strategies in New York City’s unique urban 
context. It updates evidence since the last NPCC health assessment in 2015 as part of NPCC2 (Kinney et al., 2015) 
and addresses climate health risks and vulnerabilities that have emerged as especially salient to NYC since 2015. 
Climate health risks from heat and flooding are emphasized. In addition, other climate-sensitive exposures harmful to 
human health are considered: 1) outdoor and indoor air pollution, including aero-allergens, 2) insect vectors of human 
illness, 3) waterborne infectious and chemical contaminants, and 4) compounding of climate health risks with other 
public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of this chapter, evidence-informed strategies 
for reducing future climate risks to health are considered. 
1.1 
Key Messages 
Key Message 1: Climate change-related health risks are a threat to all New Yorkers, but 
especially those most vulnerable because of age, poor health, racial and social inequities, and 
social isolation. Inequities in household and neighborhood physical environments also mediate 
vulnerability to climate-health impacts. Addressing key environmental and social drivers of 
vulnerability is an essential adaptation strategy. Many current NYC policies and strategies, 
(e.g., improving access to residential air conditioning, tree planting), aim to accomplish this. 
These efforts can be informed and evaluated using data on climate-health vulnerabilities, such 
as components of the heat vulnerability index (HVI) and a flooding vulnerability index (FVI) 
under development (VIA Interim Report). 
Key Message 2: Heat waves are, on average, the deadliest type of extreme weather in NYC 
and in much of the US. Even hot, but not extreme, summer weather causes serious illness, 
death, and other harms to wellbeing. Because of climate change, NYC will experience more 
dangerous hot weather. Most heat-related deaths are due to exacerbation of chronic health 
conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Indoor exposures can be especially deadly for 
people without air conditioning who have one or more physical or mental health conditions, are 
energy insecure, or are older adults. Also vulnerable are those with jobs exposing them to 
unsafe temperatures. These risk factors can be consequences of structural racial, social, and 
economic inequities. Adaptive measures are needed that protect vulnerable populations from 
season-long heat-health risks, including from non-extreme but hot weather. Evidence-informed 
strategies include enhanced access to air conditioning, reducing energy insecurity, engaging 
community and health provider networks to reach vulnerable populations, and augmenting tree 
canopy cover.   
Key Message 3: Public health can be impacted before, during, and after flooding, which 
exposes New Yorkers to risks of drowning and other injuries, stressful evacuation, short- or 
long-term displacement from home, and exposures from clean up, repair, water contaminants, 
and mold from water damage. Climate projections for NYC anticipate an increase in extreme 
precipitation days and sea level rise contributing to more frequent flooding over wider areas. 
Socioeconomic disadvantage, racial inequities, pre-existing health conditions, and flood-
vulnerable housing and infrastructure amplify health impacts of flooding. Adaptation strategies 
that modify these factors can reduce future flooding impacts on health.  
Key Message 4: Hotter weather can increase concentrations of harmful air pollutants, including 
fine particles and ground-level ozone, by increasing emissions of precursor pollutants and the 
formation of ozone on warm, sunny days. These pollutants are harmful to health for all New 
Yorkers, but especially for the very young and old, people with certain chronic health conditions, 
those without residential air conditioning, and those living where emissions from buildings and 
traffic are concentrated. Most of these vulnerability factors are more common among Black, 
Latino, and low-income households. Despite a warming climate, air quality has improved in 
New York City because of reduced local and regional emissions. Recent wildfire smoke plumes 
affecting much of the eastern US indicate the potential to reverse a trend of improving air 
quality. Efforts to further reduce emissions and exposures of vulnerable populations can 
prevent or mitigate climate-related air quality impacts.

Key Message 5: Nationally, pollen monitoring data shows that climate change is causing an 
earlier, longer, and possibly more intense plant pollen production season, but this trend is less 
evident in the northeast. Within New York City, pollen from several common tree species, 
ragweed, and grasses contribute to seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma exacerbations. The 
burden of asthma exacerbations from any cause is greatest in communities with less access to 
health care and more household asthma triggers leading to less well-managed asthma.  
Ambient pollen levels are influenced by local weather, allergenic plant density, and species 
composition. Air conditioning and filtration can reduce indoor pollen exposure. Attention to local 
tree cover density and species composition along with improved access to care, evidence-
based asthma management, and patient education can reduce pollen exposure, vulnerability, 
and future allergic illness.  
Key Message 6: In the northeast, changes in climate, landcover, habitat, and host animal 
ranges continue to shift the spatial and seasonal distribution of mosquitos and ticks that are 
current or potential vectors of human illness. Within New York City, the spatial distribution of 
these vectors and potential for human infection and serious illness varies with differences in the 
built environment, natural habitat and host animal abundance, human behaviors, and 
population vulnerability. Seniors, those with chronic illnesses, and people who are homeless 
are more susceptible to complications from West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Lyme disease risk 
among New Yorkers is increased among those engaged in outdoor activities mostly outside the 
city, but also in Staten Island and a limited area in the Bronx. Vector-borne disease (VBD) risk 
is also increased by international travel to and immigration from disease-endemic areas. 
Disease surveillance, vector monitoring and control, and public and clinician awareness can 
reduce future risks in a changing climate.  
Key Message 7: Climate change may increase risk of exposure to water-borne pathogens in 
surface waters and wastewater in and around New York City and could threaten its drinking 
water sources and distribution system. Increased flooding can cause exposure to contaminants 
from household sewage backups and in surface waters from combined sewer overflows 
(CSOs).  Rising temperatures facilitate the growth and spread of pathogens such as bacteria 
that cause gastrointestinal illness, Legionnaire’s disease, and a range of illnesses from harmful 
algal blooms. Extreme weather and climate change impacts on New York City’s source and 
distribution infrastructure could compromise water quality and quantity. Continued maintenance 
and adaptation of infrastructure along with coordinated surveillance of water quality, human, 
and animal health can help prevent adverse impacts on health. 
Key Message 8: Climate risks can be compounded when they disrupt lifeline infrastructure 
systems or overlap with non-climate public health emergencies. Examples include power 
outages during recent extreme heat events and the COVID-19 pandemic creating potential 
disease transmission risks in cooling centers and other publicly accessible indoor spaces. The 
health risks from compound hazards can be reduced through investing in lifeline and other 
critical infrastructure and building mechanical systems that are adapted to extreme weather, 
redundant, and flexible.  Rapid, flexible, collaborative, multi-sectoral responses are needed to 
respond to pandemics and other unanticipated compound hazards.   
2 Introduction 
 
2.1 
Chapter Scope: New York City’s Human Habitat, Weather, and Health 
A premise of this chapter is that “Cities are for people and therefore human health, wellbeing, safety, security, and 
opportunity should be central considerations in sustainable urban development (Capon, 2017).” 
Protection from the direct harm of climate extremes is just one of many basic biophysical and psychosocial needs 
that New Yorkers share with all people (Capon, 2017). In a changing climate, New York City shares with all cities the 
imperative of continually adapting its social and physical infrastructures to provide healthy human habitat, especially 
for its most vulnerable people and communities. As a coastal, densely developed city, New York has both inherent 
challenges and advantages for protecting people from climate change health risks, while enabling sustainable, low-

carbon living. These health risks and per capita carbon emissions vary considerably within the city and between the 
city and other parts of the region.   
Variation in human vulnerability to climate risks and in contributions to carbon emissions are shaped by New York 
City’s unique and varied built and natural environments, its racial and ethnic diversity, and the enduring legacy of 
racial and economic injustice and inequality shared with the region, state, and nation. Racial injustice, historical land 
disposition, and more contemporary land use policies and practices are among the social and economic forces that 
have shaped an inequitable distribution of access to healthy, climate-adapted human habitat. The topic of climate 
equity is addressed more fully and in-depth in NPCC4: Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies 
for New York City (Foster et al., 2024).  
Climate-adapted human habitat includes but is not limited to shelter, especially housing, that protects people from 
unsafe temperatures and flooding, energy services that affordably and reliably meet essential needs, and outdoor 
environments with natural and built features that enable healthy activity and mobility while also reducing exposure to 
heat, flooding, and other climate-sensitive weather hazards. Thus, vulnerability and resilience to climate risks are 
mediated and modified by the social and population context, by characteristics of the physical environment, and by 
causal interactions among these factors and characteristics (See Figure 1). This framework is the organizing 
structure for this assessment of health risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation/resilience strategies for New York City. 
 
Figure 1: Urban Climate Change Health Impact Framework. Sections of this assessment correspond to exposures. Separate 
assessment reports cover the topics of racial, social, and economic inequities (Foster et al., 2024) and energy (insecurity, system, 
and housing energy efficiency) (Yoon et al., 2024). Framework adapted from Chapter 1, Figure 14.1 in Introduction: Climate change 
and human health. The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment (Balbus et al., 
2016). 
2.2 
Chapter Organization and Scope 
This assessment will consider climate health risks, vulnerabilities, and resilience strategies in New York City’s unique 
context. It will also provide an update on evidence since the last NPCC health assessment in 2015 as part of NPCC2 
(Kinney et al., 2015) and address climate health risks and vulnerabilities that have emerged as especially salient to 
NYC since 2015.

Climate health risks from heat and flooding will again be emphasized, as these represent the largest present threats 
and because – absent continued adaptation – anticipated climate change (Braneon et al., 2024) will increase health 
risks from hotter summers, and the increasing frequency and severity of flooding.  An assessment of life-safety and 
health risks from pluvial (cloudburst or extreme rain) flooding will complement a synthesis of coastal storm and 
flooding health impact evidence, including new studies since NPCC2. 
In addition to the two climate risks that are the focus of this chapter — heat and flooding— other climate-sensitive 
exposures harmful to human health are considered: 1) outdoor and indoor air pollution, including aero-allergens, 2) 
insect vectors of human illness, 3) waterborne infectious and chemical contaminants. This assessment also considers 
compound health risks from co-occurrence of extreme weather events and of extreme weather with other public 
health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of this chapter, evidence-informed strategies for 
reducing future climate risks to health are considered. 
In addition to topics covered in this chapter, a large and growing body of evidence demonstrates how energy 
insecurity can amplify both overall climate impacts on health and their inequitable distribution among communities 
and populations, including in New York City. Energy insecurity’s role in vulnerability to climate risks is noted in this 
chapter and addressed more fully in a separate chapter, NPCC4: Climate Change, Energy, and Energy Insecurity in 
New York City, (Yoon et al., 2024). That chapter also notes how protecting public health requires that local, state, and 
national energy transition policies and investments reduce energy insecurity and preserve and enhance reliability and 
resilience of NYC’s energy system.  
Other topics related to climate change and health that are amenable to adaptation at the local level will be addressed 
in other chapters of this NPCC4 assessment, including health impact assessment to estimate benefits of climate 
action, adaptive and maladaptive uses of air conditioning in NYC in NPCC4: Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New 
York City’s Futures (Balk et al., 2024), and potential for health co-benefits of modifying the public right of way (streets 
and sidewalks); also in Balk et al., (2024).  
Climate impacts on some domains relevant to the health of New Yorkers, such as agriculture, oceans, larger scale 
ecosystems, and global health, conflict, and international migration, require adaptations and responses primarily at 
the state and national levels. These domains are considered in other assessments, including the Fourth and 
upcoming Fifth National Climate Assessments (USGCRP, 2018, 2023), and the Sixth Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Report (Pörtner, H.O. et al., 2022). Finally, while this 
assessment does consider mental health impacts of, and vulnerabilities to, local climate risks and exposures, the 
topics of climate anxiety and other mental health effects of awareness about global climate and ecological change 
and how to best respond – areas of active and evolving research (Clayton, 2020; Crandon, Dey, et al., 2022; Kurth & 
Pihkala, 2022; Lawrance et al., 2022; Wortzel et al., 2022) – are beyond the scope of this assessment. 
3 Climate-health exposures, impacts, and vulnerabilities in 
New York City 
3.1 
Heat: Extreme Heat Events and Higher Warm Season Temperatures 
3.1.1 
Current and projected future climate and local health risks 
The NPCC3 noted that observed summer temperatures from 2010 to 2017 largely fell within the range of NPCC2 
projections, continuing warming trends observed at Central Park since 1900 and somewhat steeper increases at 
LaGuardia and JFK airports. Using updated models, the NPCC3 projected that on average heat waves will be more 
numerous, intense, and longer in the coming decades (González et al., 2019). The NPCC4 climate projections 
update and refine these but are qualitatively similar in forecasting a future with warming temperatures, more hot days, 
and more frequent extreme heat events for New York City (see Braneon et al., 2024).  
Climate and emissions projections generally align in pointing to anthropogenically driven climate change causing a 
continued increase in global warming. This is due in part to the inertia inherent in the global climate system and a 
significant “emissions gap” between commitments and actions (UNEP, 2018). Unavoidable, anticipated increases in 
multiple climate hazards, including hotter weather, are creating and will increase multiple risks to humans, health 
infrastructure, and ecosystems (Pörtner, H.O. et al., 2022). In addition, in New York and other large cities, heat 
exposure is amplified by the urban heat island (UHI) effect, (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
2023b) which is discussed in more detail later in this chapter and will be addressed more fully in NPCC4: Tail Risk, 
Climate Drivers of Extreme Heat, and New Methods for Extreme Event Projections (Ortiz et al., 2024).

3.1.2 
Health impacts and pathways 
Hot and humid weather is dangerous and can cause a range of serious health impacts (Figure 2). In a typical 
summer, heat-related deaths and illnesses are not highly visible because they often happen behind closed doors in 
homes and without much news coverage. This can make it hard for the public to recognize the dangers of heat. In 
recent years, however, news coverage of the devastating and historically unprecedented heat waves in India and 
Pakistan in 2015 and 2022, Canada and the US Pacific Northwest in 2021, and many extreme heat events globally 
has underscored the increasing dangers of heat and warming climate for the general public and some policymakers 
(Fears & Eger, 2022; Webber & Sanders, 2023). 
 
Figure 2: Heat Health Impact Pathways and Vulnerabilities. Framework adapted from Chapter 1, Figure 14.1 in Introduction: Climate 
change and human health. The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment (Balbus 
et al., 2016). 
Heat exposure can directly cause heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (life 
threatening high body temperature caused by heat exposure) (Mora et al., 2017; National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 2023b). It can also exacerbate existing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, or renal 
diseases as discussed further below. Both heat-related illnesses and heat-related exacerbations of chronic conditions 
can lead to emergency department visits, hospital admissions and, in the most severe cases, death.  
Surveillance of deaths identified on death certificates as caused or accompanied by heat-related illnesses – often 
referred to as heat stroke deaths and hereafter referred to as heat-stress deaths – has the advantage of timeliness 
and can give insights into circumstances for individuals succumbing to heat. However, heat-stress deaths are likely 
under ascertained and underreported, and certainly underestimate the true mortality burden from hot weather 
(Weinberger et al., 2020). Most epidemiologic studies use a comprehensive approach of statistically estimating 
excess mortality from natural causes (i.e. chronic conditions), all causes, or broad causal categories (Petkova, Morita, 
et al., 2014). Consistent with this practice, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC Health 
Department) conducts surveillance for both heat-stress deaths and excess mortality from natural causes, referred to 
as heat-exacerbated deaths. In its 2023 report (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b), 
the NYC Health Department estimates that hot weather, defined as days with a maximum temperature reaching 82°F 
or hotter, kills an estimated 352 New York City (NYC) residents  each year, on average. This includes an annual 
average of 7 heat-stress deaths from 2012-2021.  By contrast an annual average of 345 heat-exacerbated deaths 
occurred from 2016-2020; 115 of those deaths occurred during extreme heat events, defined by the National Weather

Service heat advisory threshold for NYC (National Weather Service, 2023): “at least two consecutive days with a 
maximum heat index (HI) of 95°F or higher or any day with a maximum HI of 100°F or higher”.  
National counts of heat-stress also greatly underestimate the lethality of hot weather. The annual average of 153 heat 
deaths in the US according to data compiled by the National Weather Service (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 2023c) and 702 heat-related deaths according to the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2023a) do not include heat-exacerbated deaths. A recent study using data from 297 counties 
representing 62% of the US population estimated that more than 5,500 deaths were attributable to heat (i.e. were 
heat-exacerbated deaths) annually from 1997-2006 (Weinberger et al., 2020).  
In addition to mortality from exacerbation of chronic health conditions, higher-than-normal warm season temperatures 
are associated with an increased risk of deaths from external causes in the US. These include deaths from drowning 
and transport injuries, as well as homicides and suicides (Parks et al., 2020). Higher ambient temperature is 
associated with homicide and interpersonal violence in cities, including New York, especially during the warm season 
(R. Xu et al., 2020).  Two studies have found that the risk of cocaine overdose deaths in NYC increased with ambient 
temperature, a relationship also seen in other jurisdictions (Auger et al., 2017; Bohnert et al., 2010; Marzuk et al., 
1998). 
Nationally, emergency department (ED) visits for all causes increase somewhat on extreme heat days. ED visits for 
heat-related illness increase much more during heat waves (S. Sun et al., 2021), and are a better indicator  for 
assessing heat-health severity during an extreme heat event than increases in all-cause ED visits. Heat-associated 
mortality in NYC has been shown to correlate with heat-related illness ED visits by a roughly one-day lag (Mathes et 
al., 2017). For timely heat related health surveillance, NYC monitors EMS calls for heat and ED visits for heat-related 
illness using syndromic surveillance data (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022j). 
A wide variety of chronic health conditions can be exacerbated by heat exposure. In NYC, hospital admissions for 
renal, cardiovascular, respiratory conditions and mental health conditions increase during hot weather (Fletcher et al., 
2012; S. Lin et al., 2009). For this reason, and others discussed below, people with one or more of several chronic 
health conditions are more susceptible to heat-related illness (see Section 3.1.4.2). In addition, a recent review and 
meta-analysis of US studies found an increased risk of both pre-term birth and low birthweight associated with higher 
temperatures and extreme heat, especially during the third trimester; a smaller number of studies have found 
associations between high temperature and still birth (Bekkar et al., 2020).  
Heat-related health problems can also have adverse financial repercussions for individuals, especially for those 
without health insurance or adequate insurance (Limaye et al., 2019; Y. Liu et al., 2019). Prior work documents some 
of the heat-mortality impacts that have occurred in NYC (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 
2023k). When assessed by applying a Value of Statistical Life approach, these total at least $20.1 billion (in 2023 
dollars), from heat-related excess mortality in 2016-2020, and heat stress deaths 2012-2021 (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023c; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014a). A wider 
range of societal cost estimates to NYC for care of climate-sensitive illnesses and premature loss of life are being 
developed for the city and will be reported separately in the Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis 
(VIA) (McPhearson et al., 2024), a multi-disciplinary research effort, led by faculty at the New School in NYC, focused 
on future potential climate conditions and associated socio-economic impacts. 
Hot weather can strain the power grid, resulting in power outages. While NYC already experiences substantial heat-
related mortality each summer, in recent years the city has not had to contend with prolonged and unprecedented 
temperatures seen in other parts of the world, such as the weeks-long extreme heat that affected Pakistan and India 
in 2022 with temperatures in some cases exceeding 120°F (E&E News & Harvey, 2022). Such extended heat waves 
could be catastrophic in NYC if accompanied by a power outage. Lack of mechanical cooling for New Yorkers is a 
critical concern during a heat wave, especially because indoor temperatures can be higher than outdoor 
temperatures in the absence of air conditioning due to building thermal inertia (Vant-Hull et al., 2018). In 2003, in 
NYC, there was a 2-day power outage during hot but not extreme weather. Even so, there was a 122% increase 
among accidental deaths and a 25% increase among non-external cause deaths attributable to the outage, resulting 
in 90 excess deaths over the period (G. B. Anderson & Bell, 2012). A 2003 heat wave in Europe resulted in more 
than 70,000 deaths (Robine et al., 2008). Of those, about 15,000 occurred from August 1 to August 20 in France 
(Fouillet et al., 2006), where home air conditioning prevalence is also low. Record, extreme heat in the Pacific 
Northwest in 2021 over about a week resulted in more than 600 deaths directly attributed to the heat in British 
Columbia (White et al., 2023), many of them in Vancouver where only about a third of the population has home air 
conditioning (Henderson et al., 2022). Nearly all – 98% – of these deaths occurred in homes without cooling (British 
Columbia Coroners Service, 2021). In addition to loss of air conditioning, other threats during a heat event 
complicated by a power outage include lack of subway service, elevators and pumped potable and other water to 
upper floors of NYC’s many high rises, and strain on emergency responders. Outages can also strain the healthcare

system as more people require medical care when they lose home cooling, the ability to charge electrically powered 
medical devices, such as oxygen concentrators, and access to other essential services that require electricity. A heat 
wave accompanied by a major flooding event that damages energy infrastructure or impedes emergency responders 
could also be particularly deadly. The public health impacts of power outages are discussed further in Yoon et al., 
(2024) 
The reliability of the energy grid is key to maintaining population health and supporting emergency response efforts 
(see NPCC4, Yoon et al., 2024). Building-level back up energy systems, for example solar panels with battery 
storage, or microgrids can help buildings maintain essential services during power outages. 
Backup systems can also help the health care sector respond during hot weather with power outages. Nationally, 
hospitals certified by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are required to have generators capable of 
running air conditioning, but there is no similar explicit federal requirement for nursing homes (Patel et al., 2022). In 
New York State, nursing homes and long-term care facilities are required to maintain safe temperatures but are not 
required to have generators capable of running air conditioning (New York State, 2004). 
Heat impacts may be felt in other areas, such as schools, that could eventually affect educational attainment, 
economic opportunity, lifetime income and health. Higher temperatures are associated with lower scores on high 
stakes academic exams in the US (Graff Zivin et al., 2018) and China (Graff Zivin et al., 2020). An analysis of NYC 
Regents high school exit exams found that higher temperatures on exam days were associated with substantially 
lower test scores (J. Park, 2017). Data on air conditioning was incomplete and only available at the school (not 
classroom) level but indicated that 38% of schools lacked air conditioning and that the temperature effect on test 
scores was larger in such schools. Cumulative hot days during the school year were also associated with a reduction 
in student performance. In 2017, NYC announced plans to air-condition all classrooms to provide a safe and 
comfortable learning environment for students (City of New York, 2017). NYC school buses are required to provide 
air conditioning on buses transporting children with special needs. There have been reports of dangerously hot 
conditions on school buses, however, including those transporting kids with special needs (Coleman, 2019; Edelmen 
& Bamberger, 2022). 
Increasing temperatures may also impact food safety. Warm temperatures have been associated with more food 
safety violations for insufficient refrigeration equipment and cold food holding in the summer in NYC restaurant 
inspection data, indicating that even during current summer temperatures some restaurant infrastructure is strained 
(Dominianni et al., 2018).

Temperature, other heat-stress metrics, and health outcomes 
Environmental heat stress is influenced by several factors, including air temperature, humidity, velocity, and radiant 
heat such as from sunlight or hot pavement. A variety of heat exposure metrics have been developed to consider 
both ways in which humans respond to heat stress and environmental conditions in different settings: indoors and 
outdoors, in sun and shade, and by populations that engage in physical activity during hot weather and those who are 
able to avoid strenuous activity.    
In hot conditions, body heat is shed to maintain a safe body temperature. This happens in several ways, including 
evaporation of sweat, contact with cooler air and radiation of heat from skin warmed by increased blood flow 
(Hosokawa et al., 2019). Heat-related illness results when a person’s ability to maintain a safe body temperature or 
stay hydrated is overwhelmed by environmental conditions. As noted earlier, heat exposure can also exacerbate 
chronic health conditions, such as through stress on compromised respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and 
dehydration that decreases kidney function (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b). 
Physical activity generates more body heat and increases heat stress. People living or working in a locality can 
acclimatize, generally within a few weeks, to hotter weather to a certain extent, as their bodies become more able to 
shed heat, such as through sweating (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 2020). 
Heat-stress metrics commonly used include the air temperature, heat index (which includes humidity), Humidex, and 
the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) (Hosokawa et al., 2019). Humidity can impact sweat evaporation, a key 
cooling mechanism. The WBGT is based on temperature, humidity, sun angle, cloud cover, and wind speed. It was 
designed to assess heat stress risk in people who are outdoors in unshaded locations and to guide activity limitations 
and cooling breaks for populations such as workers, soldiers, and athletes (Budd, 2008; Hosokawa et al., 2019).  
Temperature and the heat index have been widely shown to predict population risk of increased deaths and serious 
illness during hot weather in different countries, in US cities, and in NYC in particular (Curriero, 2002; Metzger et al., 
2010a; Tobías et al., 2021). An NYC study showed that the maximum heat index predicted excess mortality as well or 
better than many other metrics and that the risk of heat associated death rose in a non-linear way (Metzger et al., 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
11 
2010a), though this study did not include the WBGT, which is appropriate for use in outdoor occupational and athletic 
settings. Despite the influence of humidity on individual heat stress, a recent multi-country study suggests humidity 
measures may not improve prediction of mortality risk at the population level (Armstrong et al., 2019). This does not 
mean that humidity does not contribute to heat stress, however. Because temperature and heat index are highly 
correlated, population-level studies may be unable to disentangle the relative contributions of heat and humidity to 
associations with health impacts.  
The relationship between unseasonably warm and extremely hot daily temperatures and health is both non-linear and 
cumulative (Gasparrini et al., 2015; Z. Xu et al., 2016). As temperatures rise, the risk of heat-related death begins to 
increase more steeply and grows with more consecutive days of hot weather. Taking the non-linear and cumulative 
effect of higher temperatures into account, there may be little if any additional “heat wave effect” on mortality risk 
(Hajat et al., 2006). It is nonetheless useful to set criteria for extreme heat events, calibrated to health risks in a 
particular locale, so that heat advisories can be issued to the public and heat emergency plans can be activated on 
days when the health risk from heat is highest. Even during periods of extreme heat, risk can vary; heat waves that 
are long and/or those with higher peak temperatures are particularly dangerous (G. B. Anderson & Bell, 2011; Hajat 
et al., 2006).  
In NYC, heat-health advisory levels have been set according to analyses of the local relationship between heat and 
mortality. An NYC study found that when the heat index reaches 95°F or higher for two or more days, or 100°F or 
greater for any period, the risk of death from chronic conditions increases more steeply (Metzger et al., 2010a). On 
the basis of this study, the National Weather Service (NWS) and the NYC Office of Emergency Management in 2008 
agreed to lower the threshold for issuing NWS heat advisories and activating NYC’s heat emergency plan to these 
levels (Benmarhnia et al., 2019; Ito et al., 2018) (see Section 4). 
While the hottest days of summer are the most dangerous to health, even moderately hot days can be harmful. About 
two-thirds of NYC’s annual heat mortality are associated with moderately hot days when the temperature is between 
82°F and 95°F (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b). One reason why these 
moderately hot days have a greater cumulative impact is that they occur much more frequently than extreme heat 
days (Figure 3) (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b). For example, from 2011-2020, 
more than 20% of late June through mid-August days reached 90°F or higher (City of New York Department of Health 
and Mental Hygiene, 2022b). While the proportion of days above 90°F is highest in July, hot days historically can 
happen in May through September. In NYC, from 2016-2020, heat-exacerbated deaths occurred most frequently in 
July (37%), followed by August (28%), June (18%), September (10%), and May (7%). Interventions to address the 
season-long risk on moderately hot days, as well as the heightened risk during extreme heat events, will protect 
public health (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b). Ongoing health surveillance can 
help elucidate risks as the NYC warm season lengthens. 
In an analysis of trends in heat-exacerbated mortality, the Health Department found that deaths declined substantially 
between 1971 and 2000 but leveled off after 2000 and began increasing in the past decade as NYC’s climate has 
warmed and the increase in residential air conditioning plateaued (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2023b). The increases in heat-exacerbated deaths are attributable to a corresponding increase in 
moderately hot, but not extreme heat days (Figure 3), indicating that heat adaptation measures such as residential 
cooling, need to be available to people during entire the warm season.

least 2 consecutive days with 95°F or higher daily maximum heat index (HI) or any day with a maximum HI of 100°F or higher. The 
EHE and Days at or above 82°F estimates come from separate regression models. Source: 2023 New York City Heat-Related 
Mortality Report.(City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b) 
The relationship between temperature and mortality varies geographically (USGCRP, 2018) even to the building 
level. Research at the global scale suggests that the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) collected from 658 
communities in 43 countries was between 14.2°C (58°F) and 31.1°C (88°F) decreasing by latitude (Tobías et al., 
2021). Research at the national scale indicates that heat-mortality rates are higher in the northeast and midwest 
compared to the south (B. G. Anderson & Bell, 2009). Another study in 11 large US cities suggests that MMT for heat 
varies between 65.2°F (18.4°C) and 90.4°F (32.4°C) with higher temperatures at lower latitudes, (Curriero, 2002) 
reflecting in part less adapted physical environments (e.g. less air conditioning) in northern cities like NYC. 
Differences in building types and in the prevalence of indoor cooling account for some of the geographic variation 
(see Section 3.1.5). Less population acclimatization may also play a role, especially when temperatures rise faster 
than physiologic acclimatization in normally cooler locations and seasons (Guo et al., 2016), such as during an early 
spring heat wave.

3.1.4 
Who is most vulnerable and why? Health, demographic, and social factors 
3.1.4.1 
Race and Income 
Heat risks to health are greater for people with lower household incomes, and other limited financial resources, and 
higher energy cost burdens, which reduce their ability to avoid heat exposure. The energy cost of air conditioning, for 
example, must be weighed against other pressing priorities, such as purchasing food or medicine (Bhattacharya et 
al., 2003; Hernández, 2016). Racist and socially unjust policies have also created differences in economic 
opportunities, neighborhood environments, housing, energy access, and have led to overlapping health and 
environmental burdens (Bailey et al., 2017) among communities of color and low-income residents. Black New 
Yorkers in particular are more likely to be exposed to heat and, as a consequence, have higher rates of heat-health 
impacts – inequities that are caused by past and current racism (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2023b; Foster et al., 2024). 
The historical roots and current pathways linking structural racism and other unjust policies to present climate risk 
disparities are complex and the social context itself is also continually changing. The historic and future linkages of 
inequity to climate vulnerability are considered more fully in Foster et al.,(2024). Some of these pathways most 
relevant to heat-health risks are briefly considered here. For example, beginning in the 1930s, the practice of 
“redlining” at the federal level designated over 80% of the Black population in NYC at that time as living in 
“hazardous” mortgage risk zones. Climate researchers have shown that surface temperatures in formerly redlined 
areas across the country are on average 2.6°C (4.7°F) warmer than in non-redlined areas, due in part to less tree 
canopy and more impervious surface (Hoffman et al., 2020a). Redlining, zoning, and land-use planning and patterns 
over time, and how they interact to create and maintain climate inequities, are discussed in depth in Foster et 
al.,(2024).These factors, as well as displacement (i.e. gentrification), have shaped heat-health risk in the city. While 
some formerly redlined neighborhoods have relatively low heat vulnerability indices (Benz & Burney, 2021; City of 
New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022g; Zipp, 2009), inequities in heat vulnerability persist. 
Neighborhoods that are home to more people living below the poverty line and Black residents tend to have less 
vegetative and tree cover and less access to air conditioning at home (City of New York Department of Health and 
Mental Hygiene, 2022b, 2022g; Madrigano et al., 2018). These pathways for increased heat exposure are some of 
the reasons why Black New Yorkers are disproportionately affected by heat-exacerbated mortality (Madrigano et al., 
2015) and experience rates of heat stress mortality that are twice as high as White New Yorkers (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022k). 
Racism and economic disadvantage create health vulnerabilities through multiple, interacting pathways including, but 
not limited to, access to affordable and healthy food, access to safe places for physical activity, and health care 
systems that do not provide care to all who need it. For example, there are large inequities in access to health 
insurance by race, income, and documentation status. People without health insurance are less likely to have access 
to primary care, receive preventative health screenings, and have fewer resources to manage chronic conditions 
(Fiscella & Sanders, 2016; Gaffney & McCormick, 2017; Karliner et al., 2010; Starfield et al., 2005; Timmins, 2002; 
Vernice et al., 2020). Sub-optimal management of health conditions because of these barriers may, in turn, 
predispose individuals to heat-related illness or exacerbation of their health conditions. Even when care is accessible, 
people of color may receive substandard treatment due to racial bias (Bailey et al., 2017). 
Households experiencing energy insecurity are much less able to afford air conditioning purchases, maintenance and 
repair, efficiency upgrades, weatherization, or utility costs of using air conditioning during hot weather (See NPCC4, 
Yoon et al. (Yoon et al., 2024)). Hotter summers caused by climate change will raise these already high cooling 
energy cost burdens for low-income households (Ortiz et al., 2022) and will further strain the electric grid, which tends 
to be more prone to outages and brownouts in marginalized communities (Berkman et al., 2022; Marcotullio et al., 
2023).   
During the deadly 1995 Chicago heat wave, a comparison of the social conditions in two low-income neighborhoods 
found that the neighborhood with high levels of social connectedness and vibrant public spaces fared much better. By 
contrast the community with declining population levels, high levels of empty housing stock and abandoned buildings, 
reduced levels of business and other street activities, higher crime rates, socially isolated seniors, and neglected 
public spaces like parks and sidewalks, fared much worse. People living in this neighborhood, which was also home 
to more Black residents and comparatively more people living below the poverty line, may have felt discouraged from 
interacting with their surrounding community, making it harder to maintain social connections to call upon during 
times of emergency. Klinenberg (2001, 2015) posits Black Chicago residents were more likely to live in communities 
with high levels of disinvestment, and that is one reason why that population suffered higher death rates during the 
heat wave. There were also some neighborhoods in Chicago with more Black residents that stayed safe during the 
heat wave, but those areas were not experiencing population decline and other forms of neighborhood depletion.

3.1.4.2 
Chronic and mental health conditions 
Chronic physical health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, respiratory conditions like 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, and kidney disease also increase 
vulnerability to and risk of illness and death from heat stress exposure (Cui & Sinoway, 2014; Ebi et al., 2021; S. Lin 
et al., 2009; Meade et al., 2020; Sasai et al., 2021). People with these conditions may be less able to maintain a safe 
body temperature or be more prone to dehydration because of their condition or medications they must take (Meade 
et al., 2020). People of color and people with lower incomes bear an inequitable burden of chronic conditions, as 
discussed above, and this is evident in NYC for diabetes and other chronic health conditions (Figure 4). 
 
Figure 4. Prevalence of people who have ever been told they had diabetes by neighborhood poverty and race/ethnicity, 2017. 
Source: (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023i) 
People with mental health and cognitive conditions are more vulnerable to heat-related illness and to exacerbation of 
their pre-existing conditions by heat exposure. In a national multi-city study of Medicare participants, those with 
chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurologic conditions, including dementia, were associated with an increased 
risk of hospitalization during extremely hot weather (Zanobetti et al., 2013). Recent studies in NYC have shown an 
increase in ED visits for mental health and cognitive conditions (Yoo et al., 2021) associated with increases in daily 
outdoor ambient temperatures above 27°C (~81°F), including schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety, self-harm, 
substance use, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia (Yoo et al., 2021). Nationwide studies among US adults also 
demonstrate these relationships (Nori-Sarma et al., 2022; S. Sun et al., 2021). In addition, several studies have 
documented increases in suicide attempts associated with increases in temperature and/or humidity (Burke et al., 
2018; Hu et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Page et al., 2007; Parks et al., 2020). 
There are multiple drivers of risk for people experiencing mental health conditions that likely play a role in increased 
susceptibility during hot weather. Mental health drivers include medication interference with body temperature 
regulation, coexisting physical health conditions, and reduced ability to recognize the heat risks and engage in self-
care (Health Canada, 2011; R. Thompson et al., 2018). Heat can impact sleep quantity and quality, which may 
exacerbate mental health conditions (Minor et al., 2022). Limited evidence suggests that schizophrenia patients may 
be physiologically sensitive to environmental heat stress independent of medication (Bark, 1998). These factors, 
combined with social and environmental factors, such as social isolation, worse housing quality, or inability to pay for 
or run air conditioning, can compound risk. Men are more likely than women to be socially isolated through their 50s, 
in general, and at older ages, when they are never married or experienced relationship disruption (Umberson et al., 
2022).  
3.1.4.3 
Age 
Aging is associated with changes in physiology, adaptive capacity, and greater likelihood of social isolation that can 
increase risk to heat (Gamble et al., 2013). Thirst and thermoregulatory mechanisms, including evaporative heat loss, 
and adaptive behaviors may decline with age. Older adults are more likely to have chronic health conditions and take 
medications that predispose to heat-related illness (Gamble et al., 2013; Hooper et al., 2014; Larose et al., 2013; 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release

Millyard et al., 2020). While NYC has a younger age structure than other parts of the state or country, it too is aging 
and in the coming decades will see sizable increases in the proportion of population over age 65 (City of New York 
Department of City Planning, 2013). Women are more likely to live longer than men, and by themselves in those older 
ages, increasing their chances of becoming socially isolated, which may increase risk for mortality associated with 
heat or other causes (Ausubel, 2020; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; Medina et al., 2020). Older adults are more 
vulnerable to a range of climate risks to health, as discussed further in 
BOX 1. Importantly, age  increases the likelihood of social isolation (Umberson et al., 2022) which itself increases the 
likely impact of climate-related stresses and may be associated with living alone. For example, most of the heat-
related deaths in British Columbia, Canada in 2021, discussed more in section 3.1.2, occurred among older adults 
who lived alone and had multiple chronic conditions (British Columbia Coroners Service, 2021). Notably, 67% of the 
deaths were among adults over age 70 and 56% were of those who lived alone. 
Heat creates health risks across the life course. Although children and adolescents do not suffer the highest burden 
of heat-related disease compared to other age groups in epidemiologic studies, they are sensitive to heat exposure. 
Infants and children (particularly young children) must rely on adult caregivers to help them stay safe, cool, and 
hydrated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
2023d). Children and adolescents may also spend more time outside during play and sports, and may take longer to 
acclimatize to warmer temperatures (Mangus & Canares, 2019; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
2023d). Few studies have been able to investigate to what extent children’s physiological differences influence heat 
risk, however,(Health Canada, 2011; Mangus & Canares, 2019), and there are also few studies that assess heat 
impacts among children. In NYC, one study found that higher temperatures were associated with increased rates of 
ED visits for children aged 0-18, with the greatest risk for children 0-4. Increased rates of hospital admissions for 
children aged 0-4 and 13-18 were also associated with warmer temperatures. ED visit risks were elevated for heat-
specific, general symptoms, and injury diagnostic codes (Niu et al., 2022).  In addition, the prevalence of any mental 
illness and serious mental illness is higher among younger adults, compared to those aged 50 and older in the US, 
contributing to potential heat risk among this age group (National Institute of Mental Health (NIH), 2023). 
BOX 1. Aging and climate vulnerability in New York City 
About 15% the population of New York City is above age 65 and this proportion is expected to increase (United States 
Census Bureau, 2021). This is a lower proportion than state- or nation-wide (17.3% of the U.S. population is over age 65), but like 
elsewhere, the proportion of the city’s population over age 65 is expected to increase substantially in coming decades (City of New 
York Department of City Planning, 2013; United States Census Bureau, 2021). Between 2010 and 2021 New York City’s median 
age rose considerably, increasing from 35.6 up to 38.2 years and the proportion of NYC’s population over age 65 is expected to 
increase by about 15% between 2020-2030 alone, and with disproportionately greater increases in the Bronx and Staten Island 
(City of New York Department of City Planning, 2013; NYC Department of City Planning, 2022). In big diverse cities like New York, 
older urban residents are more likely to come from historically disadvantaged or immigrant communities and have lower levels of 
education, income and insurance (Garcia et al., 2022; Gusmano et al., 2010).  
As New York City’s population ages and climate impacts unfold, the vulnerability of older adults to hazards such as 
temperature extremes (heat and cold), storms and flooding is a growing concern in part due to physical and neurological 
aspects of aging. Chronic conditions (e.g. dementia, diabetes, and kidney disease) and acute conditions (e.g. heart attacks, falls, 
and pedestrian accidents) are more common in older adults, with disparities in many conditions by race with higher rates among 
Black than white adults (Boersma et al., 2020; CDCMMWR, 2022; Younan et al., 2022). Aging may also bring a decreased ability to 
complete activities of daily living (ADLs) and yield changes in physiology, including mechanisms associated with thermoregulation 
(Hooper et al., 2014; Kenny et al., 2017; Millyard et al., 2020). Older adults, and those with chronic conditions, may be more likely to 
experience adverse health outcomes during periods of extreme cold and heat (Gamble et al., 2013; Lane et al., 2018; Millyard et 
al., 2020). Dehydration is also a concern in older adults (Hooper et al., 2014) and drugs taken for chronic conditions may contribute 
to dehydration risk (Puga et al., 2019). People with dementia may have a reduced capacity for adaptive behaviors in response to 
temperature or extreme weather events. Evacuation is a concern, especially for those with mobility or sensory impairments, and 
since when evacuating, medication may be lost or forgotten (Ochi et al., 2014).  
Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics compound these vulnerabilities. These include living arrangements, kin 
networks, social networks, and housing characteristics as well as ideas and perceptions about risk and planning in old age. Though 
living alone, loneliness and social isolation are risk factors for mortality at all ages, these increase with age, with risk modified by 
gender and relationship history (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; Umberson et al., 2022). Nearly one out of three older adults living in NYC 
live alone and one out of three older adults live in a multigenerational household with differences by race and ethnicity (Greer et al., 
2019). Older immigrants may be more likely to experience loneliness and social isolation (Zemba & Wilmoth, 2022). One-third of 
older adults in New York report that they have limited or no English proficiency (Greer et al., 2019). City dwellers live in a wider 
range of housing types from high-rise apartments to single-family homes, and a wider range of housing tenure arrangements 
(Molinsky & Forsyth, 2022), which place them at different vulnerabilities in the aging-health-climate interface. Approximately 6% of 
New Yorkers are  New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) residents (including public housing, PACT, and Section 8 housing), 
representing 11.2% of the rental housing stock of the city (New York City Housing Authority, 2023). Ten percent of older New

16 
Yorkers do not have working air conditioning (and 21% of older public housing residents) and 13% use supplemental heating (28% 
of older public housing residents) (Greer et al., 2019). Energy insecurity highlights how poverty, housing, and aging interact to place 
more vulnerability on people at risk of morbidity and mortality in a warming climate (See NPCC4, Yoon et al. (Yoon et al., 2024)). 
3.1.4.4 
Pregnant people 
Pregnant people are more susceptible to heat-related illness because of pregnancy-induced changes to 
thermoregulation, including increased weight gain, which may make it harder to release heat, and heat production by 
the developing fetus (S. Sun et al., 2019). Heat exposure may also lead to pre-term birth, reduced birth weight, and 
still birth (Bekkar et al., 2020), as noted in Section 3.1.2. Pregnant people who work outdoors, work in un-air-
conditioned environments or lack access to home cooling are likely most at risk (Qu et al., 2021). A recent study in 
New York State found associations between extreme heat and increased ED visits for a number pregnancy 
complications, including threatened/spontaneous abortion, renal diseases, infectious diseases, diabetes, and 
hypertension, with effects strongest among Black and low-income residents (Qu et al., 2021). 
3.1.4.5 
People experiencing homelessness 
People experiencing homelessness may be at a high risk for exposure to extreme heat, especially in urban areas due 
to increased heat exposure from the urban heat island effect. It is unclear how well heat alert messages reach 
unhoused populations and how they are perceived (Bezgrebelna et al., 2021). Unhoused populations have fewer 
financial resources, resulting in reduced ability to address health conditions that can contribute to heat susceptibility 
(Bezgrebelna et al., 2021). A limitation of heat-related illness and death data for this population is that denominators 
and standard, consistent definitions for people experiencing homelessness are not available to compute absolute 
rates or relative risks. In NYC, between 2000 and 2011, people experiencing homelessness accounted for an 
estimated 5%, 3%, and <1% of heat stress deaths and heat-related illness hospital admissions and ED visits, 
respectively (Wheeler et al., 2013). NYC’s most recent annual report on deaths among people experiencing 
homelessness showed a more than threefold rise in deaths from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, with drug-related deaths 
increasing most rapidly (NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023). While this report does not examine 
excess mortality associated with hot weather in this population, it may have risen substantially given the increase in 
people experiencing homelessness in the city (Brand, 2022; Newman, 2023), and the lack of access to cooling 
among unsheltered homeless people. Other studies show an association between heat and natural cause and drug 
overdose deaths in NYC (Bohnert et al., 2010; City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b) 
and with injury deaths nationally (Parks et al., 2020). Exposure to cold temperatures, however, still presents a larger 
risk in NYC for people experiencing homelessness. Cold exposure was the second most common external cause of 
death (19 deaths, 4 % of the total) among New Yorkers experiencing homelessness in FY 2022 (NYC Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023). 
3.1.4.6 
Incarcerated people 
In NYC, incarcerated people are exposed to unhealthy hot and cold indoor conditions due to a lack of federal, state, 
and local protections against dangerous indoor temperatures (Correal, 2019; Donavan, 2021, 2022; Holt, 2015; The 
Intercept, 2022). Thermal conditions inside these facilities are also a racial justice issue - incarcerated people in NYC 
and across the US are disproportionately Black or Brown due to a long and ongoing legacy of racist criminal justice 
practices (Bailey et al., 2017). The US prison population is also aging and has high rates of mental and physical 
health conditions, putting individuals at increased risk during extreme weather conditions (Holt, 2015). A recent 
national study found that 3-day heat waves were associated with a 7.4% increase in total mortality in US state and 
private prisons, with the largest regional effects in the Northeast (Skarha et al., 2023). 
3.1.4.7 
Occupation 
Journalistic investigations of 2010-2020 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) records reported that 
over 380 workers across 37 states in the U.S. died from occupational heat exposure (Shipley et al., 2021). Risk 
varies by occupation. The construction industry, an important employer in NYC (Jain, 2021), ranks second nationally 
behind agriculture in the rate of heat-related death (Gubernot et al., 2015). Deaths directly attributed to occupational 
heat stress are relatively infrequent among NYC construction workers (Toprani et al., 2017), though heat stress may 
indirectly contribute to other more common fatal construction injuries, such as falls (Gubernot et al., 2014), which 
accounted for 58% of the 144 construction worker deaths in NYC from 2007-2014 (Toprani et al., 2017).  
A meta-analysis of international studies of occupational injury due to heat exposure from 2004 to 2020 found that 
there was sufficient evidence for a 1% increased risk of occupational injury for every 1°C  (1.8°F) temperature 
increase compared to a regional reference temperature and limited evidence of a 17% higher risk during heatwaves, 
with the highest occupational injury risk in humid subtropical climates like that of NYC (Fatima et al., 2021). Research

(de Dear & Schiller Brager, 1998; Halawa & van Hoof, 2012). For every 1°C exceeding this range, between 25°C and 
32°C (77°F and 89.6°F), work productivity decreases by 2% (Seppanen et al., 2006). 
Outdoor workers and those who work in un-air-conditioned indoor spaces are at increased risk of heat exposure and 
illness during hot weather. Heat-related illness and death have been documented in mail and package delivery 
workers in the United States (Tannis, 2020). Recent media reports highlighted worker concerns about heat exposure 
and a lack of air conditioning in trucks and warehouses in the NYC area and across the country during the summer 
2022 heatwave (Irizarry Aponte & Maldonado, 2022; Rosenberg, 2022). One source estimates that more than 2.2 
million workers in New York State are in high-risk occupations for heat exposure (Constible, 2023). Professions at 
heightened risk of indoor heat exposure include kitchen, warehouse, and manufacturing workers (Lerardi & Pavilonis, 
2020; OSHA, 2022). Workers exposed to high temperatures who wear personal protective equipment such as 
healthcare workers and firefighters may also be at increased risk of heat stress due to reduced ability shed excess 
body heat (Bose-O’Reilly et al., 2021; Coca et al., 2017; Davey et al., 2021; McLellan et al., 2013).  
3.1.5 
Influence of buildings and the built environment 
3.1.5.1 
Outdoor urban environment 
NYC is experiencing higher summer temperatures because of climate change and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. 
The UHI occurs when cities are hotter than surrounding suburban and rural areas – sometimes up to 15 to 20°F 
hotter.(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2023a) The annual average magnitude of NYC’s urban 
heat island (comparing Central Park to surrounding suburban and rural locations) has been rising gradually and has 
been observed to be between about 2.5 degrees  centigrade (Gaffin et al., 2008). The UHI is caused by more dark 
paved surfaces that absorb heat, less vegetation and cooling from evaporation, more waste heat from buildings and 
vehicles, and less ventilation in urban canyons created by tall buildings (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 2023b). The increasing UHI may explain a third of the warming trend in NYC during last century 
(Gaffin et al., 2008). In NYC overnight minimum temperatures are increasing the most compared to mean and 
maximum daytime temperatures (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b), as expected 
with UHI amplification. The physical processes influencing NYC’s UHI are considered in more detail in Ortiz et al., 
(2024). The rest of this section addresses how the UHI and outdoor landcover influence vulnerability to heat 
exposure.  
Higher overnight temperatures can impair sleep quality (Obradovich et al., 2017) and reduce the respite vulnerable 
people need to recover from heat exposure.  In addition to the regional temperature gradient caused by the UHI, 
neighborhood environments within cities also cause variations in surface and ambient temperatures and modify the 
health risks of hot weather. The UHI can worsen human health risks and discomfort by locally increasing ambient 
temperatures during extreme heat episodes, increasing energy demand for cooling (which can lead to blackouts), and 
generating higher emissions of air pollutants from associated cooling energy production (United States Environmental 
Protection Agency, 2023d) and modify the health risks of hot weather. Greenery can decrease ambient and surface 
temperatures through shade and evapotranspiration. Local temperature reductions depend on the amount of space 
greened, however. For example, a study of overnight temperature and green space in NYC found that an association 
between local ambient temperature and vegetative cover was only observed where vegetative cover was 32% or 
greater in a 200m buffer zone around temperature monitoring sites (Johnson, Ross, et al., 2020). Forested natural 
areas within cities are significantly cooler than other locations, including landscaped areas under trees (Crown et al., 
2023). Thus, NYCs several large urban forests in parks can provide a respite for those able to visit them because 
they live nearby, can reach those that are accessible by transit, or are able to drive or bike to them.  Trees and other 
nature in locations closer to where most residences and human activity occurs in the city can provide health benefits.  
In addition to reducing air temperature and providing shade from radiant heat exposure, neighborhood greenspace, 
such as tree canopy, parks and forests, has been associated with better physical health, reduction in morbidity in 
some disease categories, lower levels of depression, and lower levels of stress and helps mitigate poor air quality 
(van Dillen et al., 2012; Yitshak-Sade et al., 2019). A greater proportion of tree and vegetative cover in a community 
has been associated with a reduced risk of heat-exacerbated deaths (Conlon et al., 2020; Reid et al., 2009). The 
intersection of the physical environment factors (i.e., lower levels of green space) with neighborhood racial 
composition and other social factors has been used to construct compound heat vulnerability indices, including one 
for NYC (Madrigano et al., 2015; Nayak et al., 2018) (Figure 5).  
3.1.5.2 
Indoor environments and health risks 
The home is often a setting for dangerous heat exposure among vulnerable people. Those who die of heat stress in 
NYC are most often overcome by heat in dangerously hot homes (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2022b). In addition, heat-exacerbated deaths occur more often at home than in hospitals or other 
institutions (Madrigano et al., 2015). Although place of exposure is not consistently recorded, exposure at home is 
also the most reported setting for NYC heat-related illness hospital admissions (Wheeler et al., 2013). Vulnerable

New Yorkers most often stay home during hot weather, even if they are unable to stay cool because of a lack of air 
conditioning (Lane et al., 2014). 
In NYC homes without air conditioning, it can be up to 10°F hotter indoors than outdoors (Vant-Hull et al., 2018). 
Warm indoor conditions in homes without AC can persist for up to 3 days after the temperatures have cooled off 
outside following extreme heat (Vant-Hull et al., 2018) due to thermal inertia of the buildings and lack of cross 
ventilation. This may play a role in the delayed effects of up to 3 days documented in studies of NYC heat-
exacerbated deaths (Matte et al., 2016; Metzger et al., 2010a). Elevated indoor temperatures also play a role in 
deaths and illnesses that occur when the outdoor temperature is moderately hot but not extreme. Higher indoor 
temperatures during the summer season can also interfere with sleep quantity and quality (Minor et al., 2022; Quinn 
& Shaman, 2017), which could exacerbate mental health conditions associated with hot weather (Lõhmus, 2018). 
National studies have documented declines in excess mortality that occurred as residential air conditioning increased 
from 10% in 1960 to nearly 90% nationally by 2004 (Barreca et al., 2013). In NYC during the latter part of the 20th 
century, there was a substantial decline in excess mortality associated with higher temperature during the warm 
season (Petkova, Gasparrini, et al., 2014). Analyses of data from 1971 to 2020 showed that heat-exacerbated 
mortality in NYC decreased until 2000, and then plateaued until 2010. Heat-related mortality rates have begun to 
increase in the recent decade as NYC warm season temperatures have risen and residential air conditioning rates 
citywide have remained flat (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b). While more than 
90% of NYC Households now have air conditioning, the proportions without access vary more than four-fold across 
neighborhoods (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022g). People with lower incomes and 
Black New Yorkers are less likely to have access to home air conditioning (Madrigano et al., 2018). Racial disparities 
in central air conditioning prevalence across four other northern US cities explain some of the racial differences in 
heat-related mortality (O’Neill et al., 2005). Adaptive and maladaptive uses of mechanical cooling in New York City 
are addressed in NPCC4, Balk et al. (2024). 
Increased heat directly impacts thermal conditions in indoor environments, particularly in the absence of air 
conditioning (Climate Central, 2021; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2023b). In a study in NYC, 
apartments without AC on upper floors receiving direct sunlight with southern exposures were warmer (Vant-Hull et 
al., 2018). The facades of the building and building albedo affect the heat absorption in a building (Bulkeley et al., 
2011; Latha et al., 2015), as does insulation. Some building types and materials require more energy to cool interiors 
and heat up more rapidly without air conditioning. For example, all-glass high rises and pre-2000 high-rise buildings 
tend to heat more rapidly during power outages (Porritt et al., 2012; White-Newsome et al., 2012). 
3.1.5.3 
Neighborhood-level vulnerability 
Heat risk is not distributed uniformly across NYC neighborhoods. The city’s Heat Vulnerability Index (Figure 5) is a 
composite measure of social and environmental factors used to identify neighborhoods that are at increased risk of 
heat-exacerbated mortality during hot weather (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022f, 
2023f). Components are derived from an epidemiologic study of heat mortality in NYC (Madrigano et al., 2015) and 
has been validated to show that higher HVI levels are associated with greater heat-exacerbated excess mortality. 
Components include measures of surface temperature, green space, residential air conditioning prevalence, median 
income, and the percent of Black New Yorkers, the population most impacted by heat mortality in NYC due to 
persistent structural racism, described in section 3.1.4.1 above.

Flooding 
3.2.1 
Synopsis of NPCC2 health assessment 
The NPCC2 2015 report was the last detailed assessment of public health risks of flooding in New York City (Kinney 
et al., 2015). Coastal storms and flooding were identified as principal climate-health hazards, along with extreme 
heat. Following the devastating impact of Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy (also sometimes referred to as “Hurricane 
Sandy,” “Superstorm Sandy,” or “Sandy”), NPCC2 focused on health impacts of storm surge flooding as well as other 
coastal storm risks related to wind and evacuation. The Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy experience showed how health 
vulnerabilities from floods are “magnified when critical infrastructure is compromised” and storm surge-related health 
risks are compounded by sea level rise and more intense storms.  
Drawing on then-available studies of impacts of Sandy and other coastal storms, such as Hurricane Katrina, the 
NPCC2 identified seven causal pathways for health impacts from flooding: 1) direct impact phase injuries and deaths 
such as from immersion, moving debris, or electrocution, 2) evacuation risks, 3) secondary hazards from utility 
outages, 4) exposure to contaminants or mold from floodwater or water damage, 5) displacement and disruption of 
services and access to care, 6) stress, trauma, and other mental health impacts, and 7) cleanup and recovery health

and safety risks. These same health impact pathways apply to all types of flooding, though their relative importance 
will vary by type. See Figure 6. 
 
Figure 6: Flooding health impact pathways and vulnerabilities. Framework adapted from Chapter 1, Figure 14.1 in Introduction: 
Climate change and human health. The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment 
(Balbus et al., 2016). 
3.2.2 
Recent and projected NYC flood risks 
3.2.2.1 
Pluvial and fluvial flooding and health 
Despite predictions of increasing extreme precipitation events, the 2015 NPCC2 public health report stated, based on 
experience at that time, that in contrast to Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy’s deadly surge, extreme rain flash flooding 
was “not a major threat to life safety” in NYC. Hindsight has shown this to be incorrect. Cloudburst events that can 
cause pluvial (rainfall) flooding continue to grow in magnitude (Huang et al., 2017), and the NPCC3 noted increasing 
observed precipitation trends that tracked NPCC2 projections while recommending research and NYC-commissioned 
studies of heavy rainfall levels that could cause severe flooding in NYC (New York City Panel on Climate Change, 
2019). Following those recommendations, the NYC Stormwater Resiliency Plan (SRP) and an associated study 
identified areas of inland flooding from heavy rain (City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2022a). 
NYC had long been under an EPA Clean Water Act mandate to reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) that occur 
during heavy precipitation. The SRP understandably focused on bolstering green and built infrastructure measures 
for CSO prevention as well as property protection – noting an 80% reduction in CSOs since the 1960s. Thus, efforts 
to understand and plan for extreme precipitation (pluvial) flooding in NYC came before the lethal risk of cloudburst

21 
events was made clear (City of New York Office of the Deputy Mayor for Administration, 2021). As recently as 
September 29, 2023, unexpected widespread flooding associated with a stalled Tropical Storm dropped over 8 
inches of rainfall on JFK Airport, exposing the city’s risk of inundation from even indirect storm hits. This emphasizes 
the benefits of addressing basement apartment vulnerability as part of the city’s overall affordable housing efforts and 
expanding efforts to flood-harden subways beyond coastal surge areas. A detailed discussion of flooding relevant to 
NYC is presented in NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al. (Rosenzweig et al., 2024) and general flooding-related definitions 
and terms are included in this assessment’s companion glossary. The topics of changes in the public right of way and 
the importance of acknowledging flood risks to drivers are also mentioned in NPCC4, Balk et al., (2024). 
Events since 2015 and the climate and flooding assessments covered in NPCC4, Braneon et al., (2024) and NPCC4, 
Rosenzweig et al., (2024) have made it clear that life safety and other public health risks for New Yorkers are not 
limited to flooding from coastal storms. Pluvial (rain-related), fluvial (from rivers and streams), and groundwater 
flooding hazards also threaten NYC. However, FEMA’s Special Flood Hazard Area maps are based only on fluvial 
and coastal surface water body flooding, and do not consider pluvial or groundwater flooding, both important in NYC 
(See NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al. (Rosenzweig et al., 2024), Key Message 2). 
The potential for cloudburst events to cause deadly pluvial flooding was made clear by Tropical Storm Elsa, in July 
2021, and the Ida Remnants Cloudburst (also sometimes referred to as “Hurricane Ida,” or “Ida”) in September 2021. 
Heavy rain from Elsa flooded NYC subways and streets, requiring rescue workers to intervene to assist people 
trapped in below grade dwellings and other low-lying areas that were inundated in that event. Ida’s unprecedented 3 
or more inches of rainfall in one hour in some neighborhoods warranted NYC’s first flash flood emergency in the city’s 
history. Storm sewers were quickly overwhelmed in parts of the city. The rapid onset, extensive flooding of roads and 
below-grade spaces of inland areas outside established flood plains caused numerous drowning deaths among 
residents trapped in basement apartments in NYC and in their cars in New Jersey (Rosenzweig et al., 2024, tbl. 2).  
Fluvial flooding occurs when a river, creek, or stream stage exceeds the elevation of its banks. Streams across most 
]of NYC’s inland areas have been filled over time, with most surface water flow now redirected to subsurface 
stormwater sewers. Only a few freshwater stream channels and small inland creeks remain in NYC (Rosenzweig et 
al., 2024). There are relatively limited areas in NYC with high fluvial flood vulnerability (Rosenzweig et al., 2024, fig. 
12). Current understanding of fluvial flood risks and projected future changes are limited by the shortage of stream 
gauges in the city, but FEMA does include fluvial flood hazard, along with coastal flooding, in the modeling to develop 
its Special Flood Hazard Area maps.(City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2023a) 
3.2.2.2 
Coastal flooding and health 
While future risks are difficult to quantify, coastal flooding is very likely to increase in frequency, extent, and height 
because of climate change and other factors covered in depth elsewhere in this assessment (see Braneon et al., 
2024; Ortiz et al., 2024; Rosenzweig et al., 2024). 
Sea level rise increases the range of coastal flooding and introduces lingering effects as areas of New York become 
increasingly uninhabitable due to chronic flooding, potentially decreasing the available housing stock and increasing 
the mental stress of unplanned as well as planned relocation. There are interactions between coastal sea level rise 
and groundwater flooding, and these complex saline-freshwater systems can be further affected by increases in 
annual precipitation, or subterranean drainage and sewer infrastructure (Rosenzweig et al., 2024). In addition to 
these interacting coastal flooding risks, recurrent tidal flooding is now a regular occurrence in low lying coastal areas 
such as Edgemere in Queens. Nationally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) identified a 
200% increase in high tide flood days from 2000 through 2021 and projected average high tide flooding by 2050 to 
occur on 45-70 days per year (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2022). Social and economic risks 
include loss of neighborhood functions such as shared beaches or piers that support community cohesion and 
recreation, and loss of housing, businesses, and associated revenues. Notably, flood insurance claims are paid for 
damages to communities impacted by recurrent overland tidal flooding that affects two or more acres, or two or more 
properties, but the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) doesn’t cover flooding due to groundwater entering a 
basement, or for backups of sewer systems (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2023a). These flood events 
can be insured against through purchase of a rider often referred to as a basement backup or sewer backup rider on 
homeowners’ insurance policies.   
Prior to coastal storm landfall, evacuation can disrupt health care, increase stress, and create other health risks, 
especially for the most vulnerable people, such as those dependent on dialysis or other types of frequent health 
services. While long-range weather forecasting improves awareness of incoming storms and increases the lead time 
available to prepare, resident preparedness does not necessarily increase, particularly for those with fewer resources 
or fewer alternatives (Rao et al., 2023). Immediate event-phase health effects include fatal injuries, especially from 
immersion (drowning) and blunt trauma (from flood debris). During the post-storm phase, health risks persist as

22 
residents deal with flooded properties and struggle with access to basic services such as power and transportation. 
Additional post-storm health risks can arise from exposures to insect disease vectors, water-borne pathogens in 
floodwaters and from sewage backups and overflows, construction-related hazards, as well as exposure to various 
hazardous materials and toxic chemicals. Long-term health effects can include chronic physical and mental stress 
from property and monetary loss, displacement from neighborhoods, social networks and services, and interruption of 
health care.  
3.2.2.3 
Groundwater and health 
Rising groundwater threatens to flood structures in a number of areas in NYC, particularly in eastern 
Brooklyn and southern Queens (Rosenzweig et al., 2024), and especially below-grade spaces. Groundwater 
was pumped for drinking water in parts of southeastern Queens until 2007, but has not been used since then (City of 
New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2023a). Intrusion from rising or fluctuating 
underground water levels during especially wet seasons can cause flooding that damages sanitary 
infrastructure and mobilizes subsurface sources of waterborne pathogens or chemical contaminants. 
Groundwater flooding can also compromise building and underground infrastructure stability, and can 
threaten ecosystems (Semenza, 2020). While globally the greatest health-related threat from 
groundwater relates to arsenic contamination of drinking water systems, NYC’s drinking water comes 
from upstate surface reservoirs, and as a result, arsenic is not detected in NYC drinking water (City of 
New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023e). 
 
3.2.2.4 
Compound flooding 
Climate change will likely increase risks and health impacts from all four types of flooding under consideration, and 
from their co-occurrence. Compound flooding (the co-occurrence of coastal, fluvial, pluvial, and/or groundwater) is not 
well understood due to limitations in modeling and less available research on household or individual health impacts 
of compound flooding as compared to singular types of flooding. A 2021 study compared various types of flooding to 
household outcomes, noting significant differences in financial, psychological and physical impacts and resulting 
coping and preparatory measures (Thieken et al., 2021). While the NYC VIA Team is currently analyzing compound 
flooding (Rosenzweig et al., 2024, sec. 8), compound flood-related health impacts are not part of the VIA analysis, 
leaving questions as to impacts of various combinations of flooding types to New Yorkers. Compound flooding 
impacts are also not included in current FEMA flood maps, which do not consider pluvial or groundwater flood risks. 
3.2.3 
Updated flooding-health epidemiology evidence 
3.2.3.1 
Flood event phases and health-relevant exposure pathways  
There are multiple possible pathways that can result in flood-related adverse health impacts. The various phases of 
flooding events – pre-event, event phase, and post-event – are each associated with different pathways of potential 
disruptions and harms (Parks et al., 2021, 2022), depending in part on the cause of flooding and associated hazards, 
such as high winds. Because of this complexity, as with heat waves, the complete health toll from flooding cannot be 
fully ascertained by immediately-available reports of injuries or deaths. Recent excess mortality studies have 
revealed a much greater toll (Parks et al., 2023) and still more health impacts can be experienced months later by 
those relocated to far off communities. As with all climate-health risks, pre-existing factors increase vulnerability, 
including health, socio-demographic, and environmental factors. The following sections describe these overlapping 
flood phase-related pathways and pre-existing vulnerability factors. 
3.2.3.2 
Pre-event phase pathways 
Emergency Preparation and Evacuation: Pre-event health risks relate to the extent to which New Yorkers have 
awareness of impending events and readiness to prepare themselves or have the ability and means to evacuate to a 
safe shelter. Emergency preparation could occur through multiple methods, including cell phone alerts, e-mail 
notifications, signage, and increasingly, clinical settings (Angelini, 2017; Madrigano et al., 2018; Patz et al., 2014; 
Trombley et al., 2017). Social media posts also have value, particularly when they permit two-way communication 
between authority and respondent and provide information on who evacuated or is in the process of doing so (Jaeger 
et al., 2008; Y. J. Liu & Fraustino, 2012; Wang & Zhuang, 2017). However, the decision to evacuate is a complex 
one, even under an evacuation order (S. Brown & Parton, 2014). While awareness of evacuation zones may 
positively correlate with evacuation behavior, exposure to prior alerts that over- or under-estimated the severity of a 
storm may also impact the decision to evacuate (Rao et al., 2023). The issue of language equity can exacerbate 
preparedness challenges faced by low English proficiency communities (Venkatraman, 2022). 
Insurance and Housing: Many people living in flood prone areas remain uninsured from flood losses. After  Post-
Tropical Cyclone Sandy, it was estimated that infrastructure damages cost at least $19 billion (City of New York 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
23 
Office of the Mayor, 2013). Just over half of the 1-4 family homes in the high-risk zone were insured when Sandy hit 
NYC (Dixon et al., 2013; Limaye et al., 2019). Moreover, even with recent changes to more risk-based pricing of 
insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), some residents are unable to afford 
premiums (Dixon et al., 2013; Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 2022; Natural Resources Defense 
Council, 2023). Also, residents outside of FEMA designated floodplains may not recognize their flood risks and may 
not choose to insure for flooding. Most tools show coastal flooding risk but are not clear enough about the types of 
flooding not shown, leading to a false sense of security about flood risks (Pasternack, 2023). Even when risks are 
known, residents may have few choices given housing availability and affordability (Limaye et al., 2019; Madajewicz, 
2020). Moreover, while NFIP is available to owners and renters, the risks they face may be different. Flood risk 
disclosure legislation and planned voluntary housing mobility programs may help alleviate this challenge (City of New 
York Office of the Mayor, 2023a; State of New York, 2021). In 2022, statewide legislation was enacted that requires 
landlords to disclose past flood damages and risks to renters (Scata, 2022)); in 2023, similar legislation was passed 
for home buyers. See NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al.,(2024) for more details on flood vulnerability.  
3.2.3.3 
Event phase pathways 
 
Event phase pathways include direct exposure to fatal and non-fatal immersion, wind-blown debris, and electrocution 
from downed and submerged power lines. Emergency communications, system failure, access to care, and short-
term displacement, and affordable housing shortages contribute to this pathway. 
Direct injury risks: Paterson et al. (2018) note that drowning is the most immediate cause of death from flooding 
particularly among men who may have greater risk-taking behaviors. Among direct injury deaths in NYC due to 
Sandy, about 70% were drownings; among those who drowned at home, at least 30% (9 people) were found in 
basements or lived in basement apartments (Seil et al., 2016). Paterson et al.(Paterson et al., 2018) also identify 
expected acute events such as orthopedic injuries and lacerations, and unexpected ones such as burns from 
flammable liquids spreading on the surface of floodwaters. Chronic health conditions may also worsen with flooding 
due to noncompliance with medication from interruption to availability, challenges accessing care, and the physical 
workload of recovery. For example, mortality rates in those with cardiovascular disease and diabetes may increase. 
Paterson et al. (Paterson et al., 2018) also identify increases in acute events in those with chronic respiratory 
diseases due to disrupted maintenance therapy, loss of power to life-saving medical devices, reduced glycemic 
control, reduced physical activity, poorer nutrition and disrupted treatment leading to increased risks of ketoacidosis 
and death. Among older adults in nearby New Jersey, ED visits during Sandy increased for the injuries already 
mentioned as well as a range of other ailments (McQuade et al., 2018). 
The majority of the Ida Remnants Cloudburst deaths in NYC resulted from drowning in basement apartments (City of 
New York Office of Management and Budget, 2023; City of New York Office of the Deputy Mayor for Administration, 
2021; Yuan et al., 2024). These tragic deaths revealed the need to evaluate risk based on locations within buildings, 
with heightened risks to those on lower floors with greater exposure to floodwaters. This is further explored in 
Rosenzweig et al., (2024) and in the NYC Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) developed in the NYC Climate Vulnerability, 
Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA) (McPhearson et al., 2024). Additionally, the loss of life from Ida brought into 
sharp relief how NYC’s climate vulnerability is increased by its scarcity of affordable housing, which has long caused 
households to live in illegal basement dwellings that don’t meet building codes for safety (Regional Plan Association, 
2022). While any lower level could be suddenly inundated by pluvial flooding, those that lack emergency exits or fail 
to meet other life safety measures increase occupant risks (Afridi & Morris, 2021; FEMA, 2023; Hornbach et al., 2022; 
Negret, 2021; Pratt Center for Community Development, 2008). 
Emergency Communications: Surveys conducted by Yong (2017) and Kreslake (2019) provide insight into 
opportunities for improving emergency communication by surveying some of the most vulnerable populations on their 
risk perception and disaster preparedness. Black, Hispanic, and lower-income households placed a strong 
importance on receiving high-quality information and assistance from the government during a flood disaster as well 
as on policies to both reduce emissions and pollution and offer rebates and loans to add cooling roofs and other 
interventions (Kreslake, 2019). Importantly, given the diversity of NYC, providing information in multiple languages 
and via trusted community-based organizations, particularly for immigrant populations, is key. In Yong’s survey, risk 
perceptions and “societal trust” were found to differ between Canadian-born and immigrant populations in Canada, 
affecting emergency preparedness positively and negatively, respectively (Yong, 2017). 
Systems Failure: The Ida Remnants Cloudburst resulted in MTA and roadway flooding, impacting resident access to 
home or work. Interruptions to transportation systems in turn introduces challenges to those dependent on others to 
provide daily support, such as home health workers or home food and pharmacy delivery. In 2012, Sandy led to 
widespread and lengthy power outages. Health effects of power outages are discussed in NPCC4, Yoon et al. (2024).

Access to Care: Access to emergency care is limited during flood events. Some emergency responders may not be 
able to travel to emergency rooms or to access New Yorkers in need, for example, when flooded streets cannot be 
traversed by ambulances. People dependent on buses or subways to access care are similarly challenged. 
Pharmacies may not be open and healthcare facilities may be unable to serve patients with standing appointments 
for dialysis and other procedures or types of visits. Healthcare workers may be unable to get to their designated 
facilities, resulting in staffing shortages. Simultaneously, hospital admissions may increase, particularly for geriatric 
patients, as evidenced following Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy (Gotanda et al., 2015; Tarbochia-Gast et al., 2022). 
3.2.3.4 
Post-event and recovery phase pathways and health impacts 
Post-event and recovery phase pathways and health impacts include greater potential exposure to (a) water- and 
vector-borne illness, (b) aeroallergens as well as (c) other harmful exposures (d) adverse birth outcomes, I stress, 
fatigue, and mental health burdens due to flood-related destruction of homes and interruptions to workplaces (Alleyne 
et al., 2021; Bloom et al., 2016). NYC health risks from aeroallergens and water- or vector-borne illnesses are 
considered later in this chapter. After tropical cyclones, increased hospitalizations from respiratory diseases, 
infectious and parasitic diseases, and injuries have been observed, along with higher death rates from these as well 
as neuropsychiatric conditions (Parks et al., 2021, 2022). In addition, the flood recovery phase introduces (f) access 
to care challenges, (g) building repair risks, and (h) long-term displacement risks. A recent systematic assessment 
identified the need for “research on disability, chronic disease, relocation populations, and social interventions (NYC 
Department of Environmental Protection, 2022; Trombley et al., 2017). Workers involved in clean up and recovery are 
also at greater risk (A. Brown, 2022). 
Water-Borne Illness: Increasing temperatures can contribute to the types of more intense rainfall-flooding events 
described earlier, with associated potential for contact with enteric pathogens (Semenza, 2020) in floodwater or 
surface water contamination from combined sewer overflows. Nationally, tropical cyclones are associated with an 
increased risk of several waterborne infectious diseases, lasting days to weeks (Lynch & Shaman, 2023). A fuller 
consideration of climate change related exposure to pathogens, other contaminants in water and human illness is in 
section 3.6. 
Vector-Borne Illness: While vector-borne illnesses can increase alongside increased mosquito breeding areas 
following flood events, for some mosquito vector species, flooding can also wash away preferred habitat and 
breeding sites, helping to reduce vector populations. The relation of flooding to these illnesses is complex, 
geographically varied, and depends on vector species (see Vector-Borne Pathogens section 3.4 of this chapter). As 
New York experiences more flood events and as temperatures continue to rise, mosquito breeding is expected to 
increase and in turn generate increases in West Nile virus (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2022l). 
Other Harmful Exposures: Cleanup of flooded properties can expose residents and workers to mold from water 
damage (see section 3.4.2) and to hazardous materials including asbestos or toxic chemicals (Smalling et al., 2016) 
as well as increase risks of electrocution (Yari et al., 2020). Tree removal workers without training in flood cleanup 
are at greater risk of injury (Ochsner et al., 2018). Construction may pose hazards including exposure to sharp or 
heavy objects as well as dust. Moreover, when power outages require residents to use alternative power supplies, 
carbon monoxide poisoning increases (Schnall et al., 2017).  
Birth Outcomes: A systematic review of research on flood impacts on pregnancy outcomes found increases in the 
prevalence of low birth weight and gestational hypertension, but no significant differences in preterm birth rates 
(Partash et al., 2022). Power outages associated with Sandy in eight NY state counties increased the number of ED 
visits for several pregnancy complications, especially among young, Black, Hispanic, and uninsured individuals (Xiao 
et al., 2021). A focused study of pregnancy outcomes following Hurricane Harvey in Texas showed significantly 
higher likelihood for adverse outcomes (Mendez-Figueroa et al., 2019). Another analysis of birth records in Texas 
showed coastal storms during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of labor complications. The authors 
hypothesize, however, that associations with low birth weight and gestation found in other studies may be an artifact 
of the method used to define pregnancy interval (Currie & Rossin-Slater, 2013). 
Stress, Fatigue, and Mental Health: Chronic flooding and the challenges of being in continuous recovery mode 
increase stress. Causes range from the stress of displacement (such as from flooded basement apartments to 
emergency or temporary housing), from the loss of property/assets, to increased financial burdens for recovery costs 
or wage losses, which in turn exacerbate mental health challenges for some, and introduce new challenges for 
others. Stressful conditions have been linked to increased cognitive risks (Zuelsdorff & Limaye, 2023). Increasing 
frequency of flood events fatigues already overworked health service providers and EMS teams. The loss of sense of 
home as a safe haven is an emerging area of pediatric research (Mort et al., 2018). Following Hurricane Harvey 
impacting Houston, mental health symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were associated

Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
25 
with those experiencing impacts to their properties, including displacement and exposure to contaminated floodwater 
(Li et al., 2021). A more recent analysis of crisis help-seeking in Louisiana before and after Hurricane Ida showed an 
increase in crisis texts as documented by crisis counseling services including “thoughts of suicide, stress/anxiety, and 
bereavement, in the four-week, three-month, and four-month post impact period (Wertis et al., 2023).” 
Short- and Long-term Damage and Displacement Risks: Short- and long-term loss of housing such as those 
immediately homeless following Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy and the Ida Remnants Cloudburst amplifies the 
ongoing shortage of affordable housing in NYC. With many affordable units being at or below grade, flooding 
frequently destroys the unit with recovery requiring full remediation before occupants return home. Short-term 
displacement also impacts the ability to access transit to jobs, resulting in less earnings, or loss of jobs due to 
absences. More broadly, children who were evacuated are susceptible to a range of mental health symptoms related 
to their unique relationship to place and time and the disruption of friend networks (Mort et al., 2018). How inequities 
shape displacement risk is considered more fully in NPCC4, Foster et al. (2024). 
Those displaced may face extended recovery timeframes, furthering the financial burden. Damage to neighborhood 
health care facilities, schools, and other services can further threaten physical and mental health among people 
remaining in their homes and/or faced with displacement and contemplating relocation. Relocation may impact 
access to jobs, schools, or childcare or may require greater portions of income for better quality housing, such units 
on higher floors. Continuity of health care services can be compromised when people needing ongoing care must 
relocate or neighborhood facilities close. Following Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, increases in emergency 
department, inpatient, and outpatient mental health visits, especially for Medicaid patients, were redistributed to 
facilities outside the catchment area of two hospitals which closed because of storm damage (Hall et al., 2016). 
Emergency planning that includes pets and companion animals during disasters is important to limit occurrences of 
trauma among people forced to abandon their pets, or who refuse to evacuate rather than leave their animals 
(Chadwin, 2017). 
Following Ida, the city identified the need for evacuation measures and communications to those living in basement 
and ground level apartments (City of New York Office of the Deputy Mayor for Administration, 2021). However, the 
city has few resources to support evacuations during cloudburst events (such as consistent neighborhood-based 
shelters prepared to mobilize in advance) (New York City Housing Authority, 2022). Given estimates of over 100,000 
basement apartments across NYC (City of New York Housing Preservation and Development, 2022b, 2022a), the 
scale of need extends well beyond available resources. In 2022, the NYC Comptroller released a new report, 
Bringing Basement Apartments into the Light, which called for establishing a Basement Board to provide basic rights, 
responsibilities, and protections for basement apartment residents and owners. Moreover, the NYC Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) is attempting to better understand cloudburst flooding and its impacts in different 
boroughs, but does not have detailed basement apartment locations (Hornbach et al., 2022).  
3.2.4 
Pre-existing factors that impact flood vulnerability (health, socio-demographic, and 
physical environment factors)  
A range of pre-existing factors can increase people’s vulnerability to flood risks. Factors include health (for example, 
chronic physical and mental illnesses), socio-demographics (age, poverty, and race, among others), and physical 
environment (such as the type of residential dwelling structure). These factors can increase vulnerability across all or 
multiple flood event phases; and people are often affected by more than one pre-existing flood vulnerability. 
3.2.4.1 
Pre-existing factors that impact vulnerability - mental and physical health 
Preexisting mental health conditions, including depression, PTSD, and substance dependence, have been identified 
as potentially increasing susceptibility to harm from flooding. Similarly, multiple indicators of chronic physical illness, 
such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, end-stage renal disease, and being immunocompromised may make people 
more sensitive to the consequences of flooding, such as prolonged power outage, water contamination, living in 
congregate shelters and displacement (Lane et al., 2013; Lempert & Kopp, 2013). 
3.2.4.2 
Pre-existing factors that impact vulnerability – socio-demographic and physical 
environment 
Household Location: Household location is a significant determinant of flood exposure. Households with proximity 
to the coastal areas, to riverine areas, or to low-lying areas of NYC, have more direct exposure to floodwaters. One of 
NYC’s biggest challenges is its sizable building stock of structures built prior to 1983 when Flood Insurance Rate 
Maps (FIRMs) were first enacted (City of New York, 2022). Older buildings are frequently challenging to retrofit to 
accommodate today’s changing, climate change-fueled environmental conditions. However, there are few resources 
available to help residents understand these inherent risks (see Rosenzweig et al., 2024 for flood vulnerabilities in 
NYC). As noted earlier and discussed in detail in the Rosenzweig et al., (2024), FEMA Flood Insurance Maps do not 
currently identify places at risk of pluvial or groundwater flooding. Also, as recent cloudburst events and recent 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
26 
flooding from high groundwater have shown, additional areas throughout the boroughs have flood exposures. The Ida 
Remnants Cloudburst showed that location in a designated flood hazard area is not the only indicator of actual 
flooding risk: below-grade areas not yet mapped as such proved to be at heightened risk of flooding. Moreover, with 
long-term sea level rise, some households are in places that will be subject to permanent inundation, such as in 
Edgemere, Broad Channel, and Old Howard Beach, Queens. RISE Rockaway and The Nature Conservancy are 
currently working with residents of Edgemere to develop more community awareness of long-term sea level rise and 
a shared community vision for Edgemere’s future (City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and 
Development, 2017; Seip, 2022). Particular flooding risks and vulnerabilities occur among mobile homes, which tend 
to be located in flood plains (Smith, 2022). While only one mobile home park is currently in NYC on Staten Island, 
mobile homes could come under consideration as a future strategy to expand affordable housing stock, making their 
over-representation in National Flood Insurance Policy claims more locally relevant (Porpora, 2021).  
Socio-Demographic: Demographics also correlate with certain evacuation behaviors: older adults may be less likely 
to evacuate, while higher-income, white, and female populations may be more likely to evacuate (R. R. Thompson et 
al., 2017). Many public housing participants in a survey about evacuation behavior did not leave their residences for 
reasons related to health, responsibility for the care of another family member or neighbor, and distrust of 
government services and support (Hernández et al., 2018). Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy revealed more about those 
populations who are more sensitive to the consequences of flooding, particularly for recent immigrants lacking 
documentation and dependent on landlords to restore their homes even as they personally lost their possessions. 
Similarly  a disproportionate number of deaths from the Ida Remnants Cloudburst flooding occurred among recent 
immigrants (Lai & Fisher, 2021). People who are incarcerated, institutionalized or otherwise under government 
responsibility and living in congregate settings may face unique risks connected to restricted autonomy and 
movement, and associated vulnerability, especially if living in flood zones (A. Brown, 2022). A fuller assessment of 
how socio-demographic factors influence vulnerability to flooding is in NPCC4, Foster et al. (2024). 
Allostatic Load: [Please refer to this assessment’s companion glossary for a descriptive definition of “allostatic load” 
and other terms.] Multiple social vulnerabilities and chronic hardship among residents of public housing impacted by  
Sandy were characterized in a qualitative study as depleting the collective “resilience reserve”, limiting the capacity of 
people to take protective measures before and after the storm impact (Guidi et al., 2021; Hernández et al., 2018). 
Following Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, the intersection of race, ethnicity, age, and economic disadvantage 
contributed to greater flooding exposure and post-storm persistent distress in marginalized communities (Faber, 
2015). 
Mobility-related Conditions: Following Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, people with mobility access needs, such as 
elderly or disabled people, were vulnerable to immediate flooding impacts, such as escaping flood waters, or longer 
term, such as isolation in high elevation apartments due to lasting flood-related elevator outages (Weichselbaum, 
2012). 
Physical Environment: Injury risks and health effects are mediated through infrastructure and building impacts, 
especially at home. Building typologies and household location amplify loss of life, physical harms, and chronic 
mental stress. Beyond the immediate health impacts stemming from compromised shelter, other conditions, such as 
energy insecurity, sustain exposures longer than the lifespan of the event. While energy insecurity is addressed in 
NPCC4, Yoon et al. (2024), the public realm, water supply, and transportation also warrant attention. 
Building Typologies: The risk New Yorkers face during a flooding event, whether from storm surge like Post-
Tropical Cyclone Sandy, or flash flooding, like the Ida Remnants Cloudburst, differs depending upon several factors, 
including the location and type of residence. Whether a resident lives in a high- or low-rise building, the risks of 
sheltering in place depend on the type of construction and its resilience. Multiple studies on building impact show that 
1-2 story bungalows are much more likely to take the bulk of structural damage during storm and flooding events, 
while high-rise buildings are more structurally stable, but may lose lifeline utilities which can reduce access to life-
saving medications, potable water, the ability to get and maintain food at safe temperatures, and increase exposure 
to heat/cold-related illness and stress (Casey-Lockyer et al., 2013; City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013). For 
example, among NYC injury deaths from Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, drowning accounted for 70% of all deaths. In 
addition, 60% of NYC deaths occurred at home, and disproportionately in Staten Island where mostly low-rise, single 
family home neighborhoods were impacted by the storm surge (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013; Seil et 
al., 2016). Post-Sandy analysis of impacts to building stock recognized that buildings in shoreline areas receiving the 
brunt of the storm surge had more damage than those that did not have direct storm surge. However, building height, 
construction type, and age were also predictors of damage, with older and single-story light frame buildings suffering 
more severe damage (18% of all buildings damaged, yet 73% of structurally damaged or destroyed). High rise 
buildings in these same areas experienced less structural damage but lost function due to systems (mechanical and 
electrical) failure (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013, Chapter 1). Residents of both types of buildings are at 
risk and may be asked to evacuate or shelter-in-place, move to higher or lower ground, or a variety of other

directives. A recent FEMA report series relates building characteristics, such as un-reinforced weak walls in older 
NYC buildings, to increased mortality risks from the Ida Remnants Cloudburst, and considers risks to life safety when 
cellars or basements are occupied (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2023c).  
Moreover, risk can change depending upon the type of material used in a dwelling’s walls, roof, and structure. 
Citywide, a substantial proportion of low-rise (1-2 floors) buildings with wood frame construction were completely 
destroyed or rendered structurally unsound and uninhabitable by severe storm surge damage, while very few multi-
story (7 or more floors) “non-combustible” steel and masonry structures sustained such damage (City of New York 
Office of the Mayor, 2013). On the other hand, many residents who sheltered in place or returned to mid- and high-
rise residential buildings, including many public housing residents (Hernández et al., 2018), experienced other health 
impacts as building systems were disabled (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013; Lane et al., 2013). If 
mechanical, electrical, or plumbing (MEP) systems are damaged by flood water, elevators, power supply, heat, or 
water supply/toilets may be compromised. In turn exit routes may be unavailable, particularly for those who require 
assistance navigating stairs. Moreover, power outages may compromise residents with electrical medical devices or 
disable air conditioning during a combined flood/heat event, which can lead to heat stroke or other illness. The elderly 
and medically compromised are particularly vulnerable (Manuel, 2013). Health risks from utility outages are 
discussed in Yoon et al., (2024). 
During cloudburst events and coastal storms, health risks are higher for those living in basement apartments and 
those with mobility limitations or other disabilities. A substantial number of basement apartments are often without 
adequate emergency exits or windows, leaving residents unable to exit during flood events (City of New York, 2022; 
City of New York Housing Preservation and Development, 2022a). This phenomenon is not unique to New York City; 
flooding in Seoul, South Korea due to record rainfall in the summer of 2022 also resulted in drowning fatalities in 
semi-underground apartments (Mackenzie, 2022).  
Power Supply: Given that the loss of lifeline utilities is one of the largest contributing factors to ill health effects after 
a major storm, NYC has made efforts to improve the power resiliency of buildings. These measures include 
cogeneration to provide emergency power and retrofitting initiatives to increase energy-efficiency to slow down 
heat/cooling loss (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013). Similarly, NYCHA and other property owners are 
elevating electrical and boiler equipment above areas vulnerable to flooding (e.g. basements) (Barnes & Temko, 
2022). Power supply may also impact function of elevators, which are critical to accessing high-rise apartments. 
Public Realm: In parks, beaches, and surface waters around New York City contaminants from urban runoff caused 
by flooding can expose people using these for respite, play, and recreation (Lapointe et al., 2022), though better tools 
and data are needed to characterize the contaminants and human exposure.     
Water Supply: There are multiple potential pathways for flooding and SLR to impact NYC drinking water supply, 
distribution, and quality. Sea level rise could cause salt front movement in the lower Delaware River, adding pressure 
to release more water from reservoirs and impairing supply (Zimmerman et al., 2019). Downpours in the watershed 
could increase turbidity and potentially runoff of other pollutants. Flood damage could potentially impair the integrity 
and function of parts of the distribution system (Zimmerman et al., 2019). Increased turbidity is often used as an 
indicator of increased microbial contamination, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal illness (Graydon et al., 
2022; J. Schwartz, 2000).  
Transportation: NYC transportation systems, including roadways which serve as conveyances and buses and 
subway cars that move people, continue to be overwhelmed during cloudburst events (Short et al., 2021). Sidewalks, 
underpasses, subway access stairs, and tunnels continue to flood (Negret & McNulty, 2021), compromising transit 
and introducing toxins to riders trying to leave subways or navigate city streets. These transportation challenges 
further compromise New Yorkers’ ability to safely move about the city and may disrupt health care services.  
3.3 
Air Pollution 
3.3.1 
Synopsis of NPCC2 assessment 
The NPCC2 (Kinney et al., 2015) projected increases across the New York metropolitan region in morbidity and 
mortality attributable to climate change through effects on air pollution, especially increases in ground-level ozone but 
also from increased emissions from electric power generation for cooling during hot weather. The magnitude of 
projected ozone changes depended on future emissions scenarios, and the greatest increases were projected in 
more suburban counties outside the city (Knowlton et al., 2004).  Health impacts of air pollution will continue to 
depend on demographic and neighborhood variation in vulnerability to air pollution, long evident within NYC, 
especially disparities in asthma prevalence. Also highlighted was the potential for combined health effects of heat 
waves and associated high ozone levels. Building-level resilience and vulnerability factors include the potential for air 
conditioning to reduce indoor ozone and pollen exposure and for tighter building envelopes for energy efficiency to

increase exposure to some indoor allergens. Finally, black carbon in PM2.5 deposited on surfaces has the potential 
to accelerate both atmospheric warming by absorbing solar visible and infrared radiation in the atmosphere and snow 
and ice melt by darkening the surface (Kang et al., 2020; Valenzuela et al., 2017).    
3.3.2 
Projected climate change and influence on future air pollution exposure 
Air quality is affected by local and regional emissions and by weather. For ozone, higher warm season temperatures 
and more long, sunny days increase its formation in the atmosphere from chemical reactions involving precursor 
emissions including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Braneon et al., (2024) project 
that rising temperatures observed from 1991-2020 will continue for the next several decades. Increases in average 
precipitation levels are projected, but in larger amounts and with greater confidence during the winter season. Smaller 
increases or possibly decreases during the summer and fall may occur. Thus, weather conditions favoring ozone 
formation during the summer will occur more frequently in the region, with the net effect depending on trends in 
regional ozone precursor emissions. However, the climate change penalty to ozone air quality is an area of active 
research, and knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain due to complex dynamics of ozone chemistry and feedback 
mechanisms not accounted for in models (Fu & Tian, 2019). For example, NOx is both an important precursor and 
when present in high concentrations can “quench” of ozone (react chemically with it) and reduce its concentration, 
especially at night and during the winter. Falling NOx emissions have contributed to higher ozone concentrations 
during the winter and in the warm season at night (Jhun et al., 2015). Nonetheless, heat waves in NYC, which are 
projected by NPCC4 to increase in frequency and intensity, cause metro area increase ozone levels to exceed health 
advisory levels, driven in part by short term increases in local emissions of ozone precursor pollutants (K. Zhao et al., 
2019).   
Local and regional PM2.5 concentrations are also influenced by weather, albeit less directly than ozone. Higher 
electric power demand for summer cooling can increase emissions from fossil fuel power plants – including more 
polluting peaker plants located within the city– -- of both primary PM2.5 and precursors that form secondary PM2.5. A 
national modeling study predicted increases in average population-weighted PM2.5 and ozone exposures in the 
coming decades, but the projections varied between two climate models used and were substantially reduced when 
reduced emissions anticipated by 2040 were assumed rather than stable 2011 emissions (Fann et al., 2021).  
Higher temperatures and drought can cause wildfires that emit large quantities of smoke PM2.5 and other pollutants. 
Modeling and monitoring show a modest fraction of PM2.5 in the region from 2005-2018 was caused by wildfire 
smoke, enough to cause roughly 0.3% of asthma ED visits in the Northeast. From 2005-2020, marked increases in 
smoke PM2.5 levels from 2005-2020 in the Western US caused little if any increase in smoke PM2.5 pollution in the 
Eastern US and New York State (Childs et al., 2022). As noted below, PM2.5 levels in NYC continued to decline 
during this period, thanks to reductions in local and regional emissions (City of New York Department of Health and 
Mental Hygiene, 2022i).   
The potential for local air quality progress to be reversed by wildfire smoke was made clear in June 2023, when 
smoke from wildfires in Canada caused a dramatic increase in PM2.5 pollution levels at real-time monitors in southern 
Ontario, New York, and other northeast states (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). 
Concentrations of PM2.5 in the NYC metro area exceeded any measured at regulatory monitors since regular 
measurements began in 1999 (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014b). State and city officials issued 
air quality health advisories (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 2023b; Notify NYC, 2023), 
advising that outdoor activity be limited, that masks be worn outdoors and will be distributed, and that people close 
windows and use air conditioning if possible. Several school districts in New York State canceled outdoor activities.  
The potential effectiveness and limitations of advisories and public health measures to reduce risks of acute air 
pollution episodes is discussed in Section 4.   
3.3.2.1 
Recent observed local and regional trends of key pollutants (NOx, ozone, PM2.5) 
Even as NYC temperatures have risen in recent decades (see Ortiz et al., 2024), regional emissions contributing to 
climate-sensitive pollutants have fallen.  Across the NYC metro area, annual average PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2) concentrations were more than 40% lower in 2015-2019 than in 2000-2004; the average of the fourth highest 
daily maximum ozone concentration (used by the EPA for regulatory purposes) fell by about 20% (United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). Air quality has improved within the city as well (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022i). Because of both regulations and economic influences on fuel 
usage, a reduction in emissions of upwind, regional and local sources of PM2.5 contributed to NYC PM2.5 
concentrations falling by close to 50 percent from 2002 to 2018 (Pitiranggon et al., 2021). The air quality improvement 
was attributable to reduced emissions from multiple sources, conversion to cleaner heating fuels in large NYC 
buildings, natural gas replacing coal in regional electric power generation, and reduced tailpipe emissions in trucks, 
buses, and passenger vehicles (Kheirbek, Haney, et al., 2014; Pitiranggon et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). See also

BOX 2. 
3.3.2.2 
Updated health effects epidemiology  
Research continues to expand the recognized health effects of air pollution beyond those long-established: 
exacerbation of cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases, including asthma, and respiratory tract cancers. 
Because common air pollutants from fuel combustion are ubiquitous worldwide and statistical power is more limited in 
local studies, pooled evidence from multi-city studies and global research is increasingly used to estimate health 
burden and determine policy. The most recent review of global evidence on air pollution and health found sufficient 
evidence to quantify health impacts of PM2.5 on birthweight, gestational age, lung cancer, COPD, lower respiratory 
infections, type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and stroke; and of ambient ozone pollution on COPD (Global 
Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2020). Health effects of wildfire smoke are usually studied via contributions 
to total ambient PM2.5 concentrations and include exacerbation of asthma and other respiratory diseases. Other 
effects may include exacerbation of cardiovascular conditions, all-cause mortality, and mental health outcomes. 
Children, seniors, and other groups may be more vulnerable. Exposure assessment challenges and method 
differences are limitations in current evidence (Heaney et al., 2022; Reid et al., 2016). 
Ozone has long been known to cause lung inflammation and decreased lung function, as well has exacerbating 
asthma and COPD, leading to hospital and emergency department visits; emerging evidence suggests ozone 
exposure may exacerbate diabetes and contribute to complications (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 
2020). Traffic-related air pollution as indicated by exposure to NO2 is linked not only to exacerbation of asthma, but to 
its onset and to impaired lung development.  Growing evidence also links air pollution exposure to functional 
impairments and diseases affecting nearly all organ systems, neurologic and behavior disorders and cognitive 
function in young children and older adults (Perera & Nadeau, 2022; Shi et al., 2020). Lower birthweight and preterm 
delivery effects can produce lasting harm on child health and development (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative 
Network, 2020). A number of local studies have observed health effects in NYC, consistent with national and global 
evidence (e.g. Ito et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2016; Margolis et al., 2016; Savitz et al., 2015). Health harm from air 
pollution occurs at levels well below US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (Weichenthal et al., 2022). 
Thus, measures to reduce ambient pollution can have large health benefits, even where NAAQS are already met.

BOX 2. Gas stoves, indoor air pollution, and health 
Gas stoves are used in more than 75% of NYC metro area dwellings (American Housing Survey (AHS) - AHS Table Creator, 2021).  
While climate change is not expected to directly affect gas stove emissions or health impacts and the contribution of gas cooking 
(including methane leaks) to NYC greenhouse gas emissions is likely small compared to emissions related to heating, (nationally, 
cooking accounts for less than 5% of residential natural gas use (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023)), replacing gas 
stoves with electric induction stoves could have important health benefits.    
Modeling and measurement studies show that: 1) emissions form natural gas burners in unvented kitchens can rapidly increase 
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), potentially to levels that exceed health-based standards and 
guidelines for short-term exposure to NO2; 2) replacing gas with electric stoves effectively reduces indoor NO2 concentrations while 
exhaust hoods effectiveness varies.(Lebel et al., 2022; Logue et al., 2014; Mullen et al., 2016; Paulin et al., 2014).   
A pilot study in NYCHA apartments demonstrated that increases in indoor NO2 concentrations caused by use of gas stoves was 
prevented by replacement with electric induction stoves, which were preferred by households receiving them (WE ACT for 
Environmental Justice, 2023). 
An extensive body of evidence, mostly focused on ambient air pollution, links higher NO2 concentrations to exacerbation of asthma, 
lung inflammation, and impaired lung growth (Raju et al., 2020; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). Because 
outdoor NO2 concentrations are an indicator of a mixture of other pollutants from fuel combustion, including diesel exhaust particles, 
NO2 concentration-response relationships may not apply to other settings and emission sources, (Raju et al., 2020) such as 
household exposure to gas stove emissions. Nonetheless, studies focused on indoor exposure to gas cooking and NO2 exposure 
have shown associations with respiratory symptoms, including asthma and wheezing (Hansel et al., 2008; W. Lin et al., 2013). Gas 
cooking could account for an estimated 18% of asthma cases in New York State (Gruenwald et al., 2023). 
At present, direct evidence of the effectiveness of replacing gas stoves with electric ones on occupant health is limited. A 
randomized study of an air cleaner intervention showed a benefit of particle filtration but not NO2 removal on symptoms of children 
with asthma (Gent et al., 2023). 
Another health benefit of replacing gas stoves would be eliminating a source of interior gas leaks that can contribute to deadly 
explosions and fires. 
3.3.3 
Vulnerable populations 
3.3.3.1 
Health, social, and demographic factors 
Children are more susceptible to air pollution because rapid development of their lungs and other organ systems, 
greater respiration rates relative to body size, and the potential for air pollution harm to have lifelong consequences 
(Perera & Nadeau, 2022). Older adults are at higher risk of death and serious illness caused by air pollution, in part 
because they are more likely to have chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic conditions that air pollution 
exacerbates (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2022a). Nationally and in NYC, Black, Latino, 
Indigenous, and low-income populations also have higher burdens of chronic diseases that are exacerbated by air 
pollution (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023i). Improved management of conditions 
exacerbated by air pollution can help reduce impacts (Hadley et al., 2022); disparities health care access and quality 
may contribute to vulnerability. Research suggests that chronic psychosocial stress, associated with social 
disadvantage, shares biologic pathways with air pollution, effects, increasing susceptibility to health effects (Bandoli 
et al., 2016; Clougherty et al., 2007; Thomson, 2019).  
3.3.3.2 
Geography and physical environment 
Nationally, communities with higher proportions of Black, Latino, Asian and low-income residents have higher than 
average exposures to PM2.5 (Jbaily et al., 2022), and are more likely to be located near busy highways, refineries, 
and other industrial facilities (American Lung Association, 2023; Y. M. Park & Kwan, 2020). In NYC, air pollution 
concentrations are associated with the density of emissions from buildings, including heating and commercial 
cooking, and from motor vehicles. Large buildings and their emissions are most abundant in parts of Manhattan, 
while traffic is more widely distributed, with the greatest contributions to emissions from diesel trucks and buses. As a 
result, in NYC, disparities in community ambient air pollution concentrations differ from the national pattern, with more 
affluent neighborhoods in Manhattan having concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 that are among the highest in the city; 
when sensitivity to air pollution harm because of population health is accounted for, communities with more Black, 
Latino, and low-income populations are by far the most impacted (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2022d). Traffic-related air pollution exposures, especially from heavy-duty diesel vehicles, is more 
concentrated in low-income NYC neighborhoods, where populations are most vulnerable and traffic pollution impacts 
are greatest (Kheirbek et al., 2016). Household exposures and health effects of some outdoor air pollutants, including 
ozone, PM2.5, and pollen, are greater among occupants of dwellings lacking air conditioning or high efficiency particle 
filters (Bell et al., 2014; Jhun et al., 2014; D. Zhao et al., 2015; Zuraimi et al., 2011). Disproportionate exposure to

industrial land use and hazardous pollutants among low-income people of color is addressed further in NPCC4, 
Foster et al. (2024). 
Despite steady citywide improvements (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022i) (Figure 
7a-d), higher PM2.5 and NO2 pollution levels within the city are observed in locations with more nearby boilers using 
heating oil or natural gas, traffic density, industrial structures, commercial cooking, and ship traffic (Ito et al., 2016). 
Reductions in emissions during the spring 2020 COVID-19 shutdown were associated with PM2.5 and NO2 levels in 
NYC decreasing by roughly 25%, with the greatest improvements in the central business district due to reduced 
commercial cooking and traffic (Perera et al., 2021; Pitiranggon et al., 2022). 
Citywide, annual average levels of four key pollutants have gone down between the first year of monitoring, 2009, 
and the most recent year of data, 2021: Fine particles (PM2.5) -40%, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) -38%, Nitric Oxide (NO) -
58%, Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) -97%.  Maps for all pollutants monitored are available in a full report on methods, trends, 
and sources of spatial variation in air quality (Figure 7).

Aeroallergens  
3.4.1 
Pollen 
The NPCC2 health assessment noted the potential for climate change, the urban heat island, and increased CO2 
concentrations to lengthen the seasons for and increase concentrations of allergenic pollen in NYC. Local 
epidemiologic studies demonstrated that pollen from several tree species common within the city are important 
contributors to allergic illness, including allergic rhinitis and increases in emergency department visits for asthma, 
during the spring season. Grass and ragweed pollen also contribute to seasonal allergies in the late summer and 
early fall (Kinney et al., 2015).  Consistent with the NPCC2 assessment, across 60 pollen monitoring locations in 
North America, warmer weather caused by climate change has led to earlier, longer pollen spring seasons and higher 
average pollen concentrations during the period 1990 to 2018. However, pollen trends varied geographically; the 
northeast region showing little or no average trend in pollen concentration or spring onset date (Anderegg et al., 
2021). A prior study of New York metro area tree pollen levels from 1990-2007 observed a shift to an earlier spring 
tree pollen season with a decline in average concentrations, attributed to regional construction and land use change 
(Kavosh et al., 2009).  
NPCC2 also noted that studies of the role different tree species play in seasonal allergy could inform urban tree 
planting programs (Kinney et al., 2015). Since then, studies have added to local evidence pointing to the importance 
of local tree species in seasonal allergy. In NYC, pollen counts from trees peaking in the middle of spring pollen 
season (maple, birch, beech, ash, oak, and sycamore/London plane tree) are associated with over the counter allergy 
medication sales (an indication of seasonal allergy symptoms) and emergency department visits for asthma 
syndrome (Ito et al., 2015).  In NYC and other locations, nearby tree canopy cover increases average springtime 
ambient tree pollen levels (Lara et al., 2020; Weinberger et al., 2016). In a birth cohort study of children born to 
women living in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx, tree canopy coverage near the prenatal address was associated 
with tree pollen allergic sensitization and asthma at age 7 (Lovasi et al., 2013). As with air pollution and health 
disparities, differences in the burden of asthma as well as in access to and quality of care could contribute to greater 
vulnerability to pollen-related asthma exacerbation in low-income communities and among Black and Latino 
populations.      
3.4.2 
Mold and fungi 
The NPCC2 health assessment briefly summarized the influence of climate change on mold and health, noting that 
increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and heavy precipitation events can promote growth of mold and other fungi 
indoors, which in turn may cause respiratory symptoms and exacerbate asthma. Workers and residents could be 
exposed to unhealthy levels of mold during post-flood mold remediation without proper precautions (Kinney et al., 
2015). 
Studies and reviews of evidence since NPCC2 have largely been consistent in concluding that climate change and 
especially flooding events will promote indoor mold growth and increase risks to human health among residents of 
affected homes and workers involved in mold remediation. Health impacts include respiratory illnesses and 
exacerbation of asthma in sensitive individuals (Eguiluz-Gracia et al., 2020; Poole et al., 2019; Sampath et al., 2023). 
Outdoor concentrations of fungal spores involved in allergy and respiratory disease are also influenced by weather 
and climate change (Anees-Hill et al., 2022; Hanson et al., 2022). 
Excess moisture in homes, whether from flooding, leaking roofs or walls, chronically damp basements, or 
inadequately vented bathrooms can contribute to mold growth in building materials that provide a suitable growth 
medium. Occupants of these homes, particularly children, are more likely to experience respiratory illness (Thacher et 
al., 2017). Mold growth on moist building materials in a basement can contaminate other living spaces of a typical 
single family home through passive air movement (Hegarty et al., 2019). In 2017 in NYC, occupants reported leaks in 
an estimated 13% of dwellings; those living in low-income communities in northern Manhattan, the Bronx, and central 
Brooklyn were more likely to report leaks compared with residents of other neighborhoods (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023g). These same communities have greater proportions of people with 
asthma who are more susceptible to mold and other aeroallergens in the home (City of New York Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022c). Compounding these impacts, with COVID-19, those with lung damage from mold 
are at greater risk (e.g. populations in public housing, elderly populations, young children, people with asthma & other 
respiratory comorbidities, disabled populations and lower-income populations) (B. Hirsch, 2020).

Vector-borne pathogens 
3.5.1 
Synopsis of NPCC2 assessment  
NPCC2 noted that some mosquito- and tick-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Lyme disease are 
endemic in New York State. Climate change, including warming temperature and changes in precipitation patterns, 
can shift the seasonal cycle and/or spatial distribution of mosquito and tick vectors of these and other diseases 
affecting humans. Locally, climate change is expected to produce warmer weather in all seasons of the year as well 
as more flooding from extreme rain, rising sea levels, and coastal storms. Without adaptation, climate change will 
increase the risk of vector-borne illnesses among New Yorkers, including the potential introduction of diseases not 
currently transmitted in the metro area. However, climate change is only one of multiple factors influencing vector 
habitat and disease risk for humans, (Kinney et al., 2015).  
3.5.2 
Climate change projections and influence on risk  
Life cycles, population, and activities of mosquitos and ticks are sensitive to interactions among climate variables 
including temperature and rainfall. One national study showed increased temperature, humidity, and heavy 
precipitation to predict human WNV infection rates in the US (Soverow et al., 2009), but more recent studies show the 
importance of drought preceding WNV epidemics (Paull et al., 2017; Shaman et al., 2005). Climate change is shifting 
and will continue to shift the geographic distribution of ticks that transmit Lyme and other human diseases (Alkishe et 
al., 2021). 
While climate is undoubtedly important, complex, dynamic interactions among climate, animals, land use, human 
settlement and behavior patterns limit the utility of climate-disease modeling for predicting future vector-borne 
disease risks and informing prevention strategies (Bardosh et al., 2017). Historical trends show how complex, non-
climate factors introduced malaria and yellow fever to the Americas, and the role these factors likely played in their 
elimination in the US. Malaria and yellow fever likely came to the Americas during the slave trade in the 17th century 
and caused recurrent outbreaks in NYC and as far north as New England (Eastman, 2021; Moreno-Madriñán & 
Turell, 2018). Because humans are the primary host for amplifying these mosquito borne diseases, improved living 
conditions that reduced indoor mosquito contact, such as screens, elimination of open cisterns, and air conditioning, 
likely played a major role in eliminating sustained local transmission of malaria and yellow fever in the US (Eastman, 
2021; Moreno-Madriñán & Turell, 2018). 
The Fourth National Climate Assessment concluded that climate change will alter the geographic range, seasonal 
distribution, and abundance of disease vectors, but also the influence on future risks of interactions with “changing 
ecosystems and land use, demographics, human behavior, and the status of public health infrastructure and 
management” (USGCRP, 2018). Future risk estimates depend on how these complex interactions are modeled. For 
example, an increase in WNV, the most common mosquito-borne illness in NYC, is anticipated under a changing 
climate (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022l; Keyel et al., 2021), but in one study, a 
mosquito biology model contradicted a climate model, predicting decreased WNV-risk in currently high-risk locations 
leading to an overall decline in population-weighted risk (Keyel et al., 2021). In addition, human acquired immunity 
after regional outbreaks may also limit WNV transmission (Paull et al., 2017).  
Similarly, a warming climate is expanding the northern range of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) – the vector 
for Lyme disease (Alkishe et al., 2021), and Lyme disease cases and exposure to the tick vector in New York State 
are associated with warmer days and mild winter temperatures (S. Lin et al., 2019), but non-climate factors have also 
played a role as described in Section 3.5.3.2.  
3.5.3 
National, regional, and local vector-borne disease (VBD) trends 
3.5.3.1 
West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses 
The West Nile virus (WNV) in the US was first identified in NYC in 1999, and it has remained a threat to public health 
ever since. Nationally, more than 55,000 cases and 2600 deaths from WNV have been reported to CDC from 1999 
through 2021, with the highest rates of neuroinvasive disease among older adults and residents of West North 
Central, East South Central, and Mountain regions.(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022b). Cases have 
fluctuated substantially from year to year during that period; national rates were fairly stable from 2013-2018 
(McDonald et al., 2021).  
Within NYC in 2015-2020, reported cases ranged between 6 and 38, with no clear trend (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2019). 377 cases of neuroinvasive (severe) presentations of West Nile 
and 47 deaths have been recorded in NYC residents from 1999-2021 (Bajwa W, Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 2022). 
WNV infection is asymptomatic in 70-80% of cases.  People with symptomatic infection can experience fever, 
headache, weakness, muscle, and joint pain. Less than 1% of cases will develop WNV encephalitis and/or myelitis 
meningitis, which is inflammation of tissues surrounding the brain, brain stem, or spinal cord and can lead to serious

34 
morbidities and even death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023c). Because most infections are 
asymptomatic and symptoms are variable, reported cases are much less than the true number of infections.   
NYC collects and tests pools of mosquitos for the presence of WNV at 53 permanent locations across the 5 
boroughs, with additional collection sites deployed based on surveillance data.  In 2022, the number of WNV-positive 
mosquito pools, 1555, was the highest ever detected (Baisas, 2022; City of New York Department of Health and 
Mental Hygiene, 2023m). This could be due to increased extreme precipitation events, warmer air temperature, lack 
of behavioral vigilance, or some combination. Summer of 2022 in NYC was its 6th hottest in recorded history, and 
rainfall was four inches below average (Davitt, 2022). The combination of hotter temperatures and dry conditions 
could have contributed to an increase in WNV infected mosquito pools.  
Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito that most commonly transmits chikungunya, dengue and Zika, is not found in 
NYC, and cases of these diseases among New Yorkers are typically attributed to travel to other places with this 
vector (Bajwa et al., 2022). Aedes albopictus is present in NYC and is capable of transmitting Zika, dengue, 
chikungunya, and other viruses, but less efficient at doing so compared to Aedes aegypti (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2023d).   
3.5.3.2 
Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases (TBDs)  
Nationally, between 30,000 and 40,000 Lyme disease cases are reported annually; the number of confirmed and 
probable cases fluctuated with no clear trend between 2008 and 2019 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2022c). According to the most recent NYC Health Department surveillance report, (City of New York Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022a) Lyme and other TBD cases among NYC residents have been trending upward 
for more than 15 years (Figure 8). The abrupt increase in 2022 Lyme diseases cases is an artifact of a changed CDC 
case definition (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023n). Tick-borne diseases (TBD) 
among New Yorkers are mainly acquired through travel outside of NYC to surrounding areas where the diseases are 
endemic. Locally acquired Lyme disease cases are most common in Staten Island (City of New York Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023n; Goldstein, 2023). Lyme disease remains the most reported TBD. 
People acquire TBDs when bit by a tick carrying the infectious agent, usually during outdoor activity among residents 
or visitors to regions with a temperate climate and local habitat that supports the lifecycles of the tick vector. For 
Lyme disease, the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the vector, and the causal agent is the spirochete Borrelia 
burgdorferi. Lyme disease cases can occur at any time of the year, but are highest in the spring and summer, both 
due to the activity of the nymphs and an increase in outdoor activities (Bush & Vazquez-Pertejo, 2018). 
New and emerging tick vectors and TBDs are being detected in New York State and in the city. In addition to the 
blacklegged or deer tick vector for Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Powassan virus, the American dog 
tick, which can transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the lone star tick, a vector of ehrlichiosis, the Asian long 
horned tick, and Gulf Coast tick have been detected in NYC (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2022a). 
The Asian long-horned tick and lone star ticks are also established in Staten Island and parts of the Bronx. The Asian 
long-horned tick was first reported in the US in 2017 but has not yet been shown to transmit disease, though 
internationally they have been shown to spread several animal and human diseases (Pritt, 2020). The American dog 
tick is found in all five boroughs of NYC (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2017). The Gulf 
Coast tick is also in Staten Island. These established ticks, along with the blacklegged tick, have tested positive for 
multiple pathogens (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023n).

3.5.4 
Factors influencing population vulnerability 
The differences in population vulnerability to a mosquito- or tick-borne illness is influenced by a combination of 
individual health and behavioral factors, socioeconomic factors and living conditions, and nearby landcover, habitat, 
and ecosystem factors that influence disease vectors abundance, behavior, and encounters with people.  
3.5.4.1 
Mosquito-borne illness 
Those considered the most susceptible to severe West Nile virus (WNV) infections include the elderly, homeless, and 
those with underlying conditions or compromised immunity (Ronca et al., 2021). Outdoor workers are at increased 
risk of exposure to WNV-infected mosquitos (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022a). Those living in 
homes with poorly fitting doors and windows or without door and window screens are also at increased risk (Bajwa 
W, Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 2022).  
Landcover, including both natural, agricultural, and urban features, can create mosquito breeding habitat. These 
interact with climate and nearby populations, living conditions, and behaviors to influencing potential exposure to 
mosquitos carrying WNV and other diseases (DeGroote & Sugumaran, 2012; Keyel et al., 2019). Examples of places 
where standing water can support mosquito breeding include puddles, pools, catch basins, bird baths, rain gutters, 
portable swimming pools, and puddles (Bajwa W, Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 2022). The NYC Health Department 
recorded 1,661 complaints of standing water in NYC in 2021 for mosquitoes (Bajwa W, Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 
2022). 
In addition to climate change influencing trends in locally endemic mosquito-borne illness, another concern is the risk 
of reintroduction and sustained local transmission of once endemic diseases. A recent report documents locally 
transmitted cases of malaria in 2023 in Florida (7 cases), Texas (1 case), and Maryland (1 case), the first in the US 
since 2003. While the risk of sustained local transmission of malaria in the US remains extremely low, these cases 
demonstrate the importance of public health surveillance and prompt treatment of human cases (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2023e).

Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk

Human hosts are also important for local transmission of the mosquito borne illnesses dengue, chikungunya, and 
Zika viruses.  Each year, multiple travelers return to NYC with active dengue or malaria infections acquired in places 
where those diseases are endemic, but Aedes aegypti, the insect vector for these diseases, is not currently found in 
NYC and local transmission has not been sustained. This could change if Aedes aegypti or another competent insect 
vector became established locally (Bajwa W, Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 2022; Moreno-Madriñán & Turell, 2018).   
Socioeconomic and living conditions are another factor that could influence the risk of these diseases becoming 
locally endemic. For example, a study comparing the incidence of dengue fever in adjacent towns of Nuevo Laredo, 
Mexico and Laredo, Texas found a higher risk in Nuevo Laredo despite the greater abundance of dengue-carrying 
mosquitos in Laredo. Differences were attributed to living conditions, including Laredo’s having more residential 
screens, air conditioning, spacing between homes, and more indoor space per occupant (Reiter et al., 2003).  
Land cover change and mosquito control efforts likely also played a role in controlling mosquito borne diseases in the 
US. These factors will remain important in shaping the future risk for diseases like WNV, which require animal, rather 
than human hosts to sustain local populations and transmission. The development and urbanization of the mid-
Atlantic and northeast states in the 20th century resulted in salt marsh wetlands being modified or lost to alternative 
uses or for mosquito control efforts. Over time, integrated marsh management (IMM) methods have been developed 
to support or enhance habitat (Wolfe et al., 2022) and aid in the control mosquito vectors of human disease in 
combination with integrated pest management (IPM) methods, such as those employed by NYC’s mosquito control 
program (Bajwa W, Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 2022).  
3.5.4.2 
Tick-borne illness 
Nationally, reported Lyme disease is more common among men than women; the age distribution of cases is fairly 
uniform, but the proportion with neurologic, arthritic, or cardiac manifestations is highest among children and middle-
aged adults (A. M. Schwartz, 2017). In a survey of people reported with Lyme disease in Pennsylvania, lack of health 
insurance was a risk factor for delayed treatment, which in turn is a risk for more serious and post-treatment 
symptoms (A. G. Hirsch et al., 2020). An electronic health record study in Pennsylvania found access to primary or 
urgent care was protective and that Medicaid-insured patients were at higher risk of more severe illness (Moon et al., 
2021). Among occupations, agricultural and forestry workers are at increased risk (Magnavita et al., 2022). 
Because Lyme disease is the most common tick-born illness in the US and NYC area, its vector, the blacklegged tick, 
has been extensively studied. Historically, its range may have spread in the northeastern US as forest habitat and 
deer populations expanded during the last century (Dennis et al., 1998). Today, blacklegged ticks are established in 
Staten Island, in Pelham Park in the Bronx but not in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022h). A study of NYC parks showed that the density of nymph 
blacklegged ticks and carrying the spirochete causing Lyme was greatest in parks with high connectivity and 
vegetated buffers, favorable habitat for the white-tailed deer, which is a host species for adult ticks (VanAcker et al., 
2019). Since 2006, the NYC Health Department has conducted tick surveillance annually in a subset of NYC parks, 
however, the department notes that information on tick populations in the city is limited (City of New York Department 
of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023j).  
3.6 
Water-borne Pathogens and Other Contaminants 
Globally, increasing temperatures and flooding related to climate change can increase water borne disease risk such 
as from enteric pathogens and legionella (BOX 3) (Semenza, 2020). Local waterborne disease risks and their 
relationship to climate change are highly dependent on infrastructure, including that involved in drinking water supply 
and treatment, wastewater and stormwater management and treatment, and building systems including potable water 
supply, cooling towers, and fountains. For NYC’s drinking water supply to be impacted, damage to the upstate source 
watershed and/or water mains typically would have to occur. However, power outages will cause loss of potable 
water supply in tall buildings when rooftop tanks are exhausted (NYC Department of Environmental Protection, 2022). 
Yet, there are multiple potential pathways for flooding and SLR to impact NYC drinking water supply, distribution, and 
quality. Sea level rise could cause salt front movement in the lower Delaware River, adding pressure to release more 
water from reservoirs and impairing supply (Zimmerman et al., 2019). Downpours in the watershed could increase 
turbidity and potentially runoff of other pollutants. Increased turbidity has been associated with an increased risk of 
gastrointestinal illness (GI), though by itself does not cause GI illness (Graydon et al., 2022; J. Schwartz, 2000). 
Pathogen growth and availability increase with warmer temperatures, so flooding in warmer months, such as that with 
Hurricane Ida, introduces additional risks (Escobar et al., 2015; Trtanj et al., 2016). Vibrio bacteria naturally live in 
coastal salt and brackish waters and include species that cause human infections, most often gastrointestinal illness 
caused by ingestion of raw or undercooked shellfish. Less often, vibrio contact with open skin wounds can cause 
infection. About 110-140 vibrio infections are reported to the NYC Health Department annually. Recently, the US 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
37 
CDC issued a national health alert concerning potentially life-threatening infections caused by Vibrio vulnificus that 
have been associated with warming coastal waters. In 2023, so far, one Vibrio vulnificus case was reported in an 
NYC resident (compared to about one to three annually), who reported eating shellfish but not exposure to coastal 
waters (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023a). 
In general, water-borne illnesses reported after major storms demonstrate increases in cases of gastrointestinal 
illness due to resident exposures to sewage contaminated floodwaters (Liang & Messenger, 2018). Following 
extensive flooding caused by Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy, the overall risk of food and waterborne illness in the NYC 
area receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment did not increase, but there was a small increase in outpatient food and 
waterborne illness among those age 65 and older (Greene et al., 2013).  
BOX 3. Legionella 
Legionella bacteria are present in the environment and can grow in potable water systems and in cooling towers commonly used for 
air conditioning and commercial refrigeration in large NYC buildings. If released in aerosol form, community outbreaks of legionella 
pneumonia can occur (Paschke et al., 2019). Warm temperatures and humidity are associated with increased rates of Legionnaire’s 
disease (Simmering et al., 2017), likely related both to favorable conditions for growth of the agent and use of cooling towers. In 
2015 an outbreak of Legionnaire’s Disease in the Bronx resulted in 138 confirmed cases and 16 deaths. The source was traced to a 
single cooling tower (Weiss et al., 2017). A local law and health regulations enacted that same year, created requirements for 
permitting, maintenance, and inspection (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023d).Coordinated 
surveillance connecting human, animal, and environmental health can help with early detection of water-borne disease outbreaks 
(Semenza, 2020). 
Degradation in surface water quality around the city is a risk after any major rain or flooding event, potentially 
exposing recreational water users. This is because combined mains handle stormwater runoff and sewage in many 
parts of the city can overwhelm treatment facilities during significant rain events and cause discharge of untreated 
sewage. The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (2023h) maintains beach monitoring and surveillance 
and issues advisories and closures during the summer season.  
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are caused when algae and cyanobacteria grow rapidly in bodies of water. Illness in 
people and pets is most often from exposures to toxins produced by these organisms via skin contact, inhalation, 
ingestion of contaminated water, or consumption of contaminated seafood. HABs are more common in warm months 
and in fresh water. A wide range of symptoms and illnesses can result, including skin and respiratory tract irritation 
from contact with contaminated water or inhalation of droplets, gastrointestinal and neurologic illness from ingestion 
of contaminated food or water. Dogs, livestock, and wildlife are also harmed by HABS (Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2023b).  
A global increase in HABs is being driven by climatic and non-climatic factors. National data also show an increase in 
the number, types, and geographic range of HABs (Gobler, 2020). The increase in HABs driven by several factors, 
including climate change and rising water temperatures, improved detection and reporting, nutrient pollution, 
introduction of species to new areas (D. M. Anderson et al., 2021). In New York State, HAB reports increased in 
frequency from 2012-2020 (Gorney et al., 2023), and HABs regularly impact some NYC freshwater ponds and lakes 
(City of New York Department of Parks & Recreation, 2023b). More recent, detailed state level data are available, 
and show 53 HABs reported for water bodies within the five boroughs from 2019 through 2022 (New York State 
Department of Environmental Conservation, 2023a).  
3.7 
Other Compound Impacts 
Hot summer weather combined with the risk of COVID-19 transmission for the first time in summer 2020. Indoor 
gatherings such as at public cooling centers, which can provide a respite for those unable to stay cool at home, were 
limited. A pilot survey of members of an environmental justice organization during the summer of 2020 suggested 
people were more likely to stay indoors, avoid crowded green spaces, and rely on home AC units (WE ACT for 
Environmental Justice, 2021). A racial disparity in access to AC was also shown, consistent with prior surveys. 
Another evaluation study of the short-term impacts of an NYC program that distributed and installed 73,000 air 
conditioners in summer 2020 indicated that program participants were more likely to report that they stayed home 
during hot weather compared to non-participants, with similar levels of staying home among the two groups in 2019. 
Program participants were also less likely to report that hot weather made them, or household members feel sick at 
home during summer 2020. Concern about cost of cooling, a hallmark of energy insecurity, was common among both 
groups and was a barrier to accessing air conditioning (Lane et al., 2023). Limited access to outdoor green space 
was noted in another survey (Bock et al., 2021, 2021); power outages during hot weather would amplify these risks 
(Watkins & Southall, 2019). The co-occurring emergencies of extreme heat and COVID-19 highlighted the need to 
continue, expand, and evaluate efforts to address disparities in cooling access, energy affordability, and green space

in high heat-vulnerable neighborhoods (City of New York Department of Parks & Recreation, 2023a). Similarly, urban 
flooding preparations, as well as efforts to address basement apartments, were interrupted due to COVID-19 
demands for budget reallocations (City of New York, 2016).  
Other compound impacts have been considered in earlier sections, including the co-occurrence of hot weather and 
higher ozone levels, amplification of heat and flooding impacts by power outages, and the potential for hot weather 
and flooding to cause exposure to pathogens and other contaminants in water. Hurricanes and other storms that 
cause power outages and occur during hot or cold weather can be dangerous. The 2017 example of Hurricane Irma 
in Florida is discussed in Yoon et al., (2024). Most recently, when extreme heat combined with wildfire smoke, as 
prominent in June 2023, potential concurrent exposures introduced greater health risks (Rosenthal et al., 2022) 
increasing the importance of residential air conditioning for protecting vulnerable people. 
4 Reducing Future Impacts 
Many cities are implementing measures to provide immediate public health protections from the health impacts of 
climate change. Several of NYC’s measures and plans as well as those of some other cities are discussed below. 
Structural measures that rely less on behavior change and individual efficacy are generally more effective at the 
population level. Hence, measures that advance health, equity, and safety by adapting the built and natural 
environment, while enhancing natural features and ecosystems and supporting greenhouse gas  reduction targets 
where feasible, are the most important. 
4.1 
Public Health Messaging and Risk Awareness 
General principles: Climate risks to health vary greatly among communities and populations, making clear, 
actionable communication, especially to vulnerable groups, essential for effective emergency preparedness and 
response. Vulnerable populations are most reliant upon government services when an evacuation order is issued, 
making the timely deployment of those services and their context-dependent response extremely important to reduce 
negative health impacts. Evacuation behavior and response may differ throughout the population of NYC for a wide 
variety of reasons, so a coordinated effort from the city to address this reality will improve outcomes, particularly for 
those in public housing, those who have health conditions and disabilities, and the elderly. Public health strategies 
reliant on individual agency and behavior change are inherently less effective than structural interventions that 
address socioeconomic determinants or the environmental context for health (Frieden, 2010). Thus, to reduce future 
climate change impacts on health, policies and investments that reduce housing and energy insecurity and ensure 
the resilience of dwellings and infrastructure are essential complementary approaches to effective public health 
communication. A population that is informed about climate risks and options for avoidance of risks will be better able 
to engage in collective advocacy for structural measures and act in the near term to reduce exposures and risks. 
Specific strategies and approaches are described below. 
Heat-health warning systems: NYC activates its heat emergency plan when the National Weather Service (NWS) 
forecasts extreme heat. The NWS definition of extreme heat – two or more days when the maximum heat index is 
predicted to reach 95°F or any period when it reaches 100°F – is based on analyses of NYC heat and mortality data 
(Metzger et al., 2010a). One study estimated that reducing the heat emergency threshold from 105°F to these lower 
levels in 2008 reduced heat-related illnesses among Medicare beneficiaries in NYC in the two years after 2008 
compared to the two years before (Benmarhnia et al., 2019). During emergencies, NYC officials disseminate public 
messaging about the health dangers of heat to the public, health care and social service providers, and faith- and 
community-based organizations. People are urged to use air conditioning if they have it or visit an air-conditioned 
space, such as a Cooling Center. Messaging around setting AC to low-cool or 78°F is also typically included to help 
with costs of cooling and reducing energy use to protect the power grid. Members of the public are also asked to 
check in on family, neighbors and friends who may be at risk during hot weather to help them stay cool (See NYC’s 
“Be a Buddy” program (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022)). More outreach 
workers are deployed to offer shelter to people experiencing homelessness, and shelters are open to anyone who 
needs them (City of New York Department of Homeless Services, 2023). 
It is important to note that warning systems have several limitations. People without air conditioning who have limited 
mobility may have difficulty accessing public cooling resources, people may be reluctant to leave home during heat 
waves to visit a cooling center (see section on Cooling Centers below), and emergency warnings are released only 
on the hottest and most dangerous days to avoid alert fatigue. These limitations highlight the need to couple 
emergency warning and response systems with other strategies to maintain safety throughout the warm season, 
including hot but not extreme heat days. 
Surveys have also shown that while heat warning awareness is generally high among New Yorkers, awareness is 
lower among those who may be more at risk, which may be in part due to perceived lack of risk of hot weather, which

39 
occurs every summer, and because messages may not effectively reach those most at risk. Trusted messengers for 
heat-health warnings and information included health professionals, local TV health and medical correspondents, and 
meteorologists (Lane et al., 2014). 
Flood risk awareness: Additional measures to help New Yorkers to understand the health and property risks 
associated with flooding are needed. FEMA recently published a series of online resources that highlight ways that 
building owners and tenants can reduce flood risks in urban buildings (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
2023b). Emergency preparedness education, such as Know Your Zone and ReadyNYC, are ongoing local programs 
to increase awareness of neighborhood risks. Education on finding safe local shelters as well as sheltering in place 
are important to limit compound risks from transmissible illnesses. Existing programs could be enhanced by 
increasing awareness of precipitation-driven flooding. Recent NYS legislation to inform renters and homeowners of 
flood history (Assembly Bill 2023-A1967, 2023), or to improve community awareness of climate hazards, requires 
sustained engagement to become part of the New York experience. Assuring translation into multiple languages and 
offering multiple means of delivering these messages, with assistive technologies for sight, hearing, or mobility 
impairment is key. Otherwise, those with vision or hearing impairments and without assistive technology may not 
receive such warnings. NYC Emergency Management translates public materials, outreach materials, and Notify 
NYC messages and website into the 10 languages designated by Local Law 30 (Local Law 30, 2017) as well as two 
additional languages, Yiddish and Italian, which are two of the top 10 languages spoken in NYC hurricane evacuation 
zones. To assess and support Local Law 30 implementation, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs works with NYC 
Emergency Management and other agencies and issues regular public reports (NYC Mayor’s Office of Immigrant 
Affairs & NYC Mayor’s Office of Operations, 2022). While most of these resources are accessible online, 16% of 
households in NYC remain without broadband access. Finally, it is important to help New Yorkers to understand how 
personal choice impacts flooding in NYC. For example, DEP’s ongoing WAIT program encourages New Yorkers to 
monitor and where possible to reduce their potable water use during flooding events, in turn reducing the amount of 
sewer water combining with stormwater outflows (City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2023b).  
Air quality health advisories and related public health measures: High levels of PM2.5 caused by wildfire smoke 
and high levels of ozone during hot weather generally cause poor air quality across the NYC metro area. Computer 
models of weather and pollutant emissions as well as monitor data are used to forecast harmful pollution episodes.  
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and the NYS Department of Health issue 
regional air quality health advisories when “DEC meteorologists predict levels of ozone or PM2.5” that are greater than 
national ambient air quality criteria for short term exposure (New York State Department of Environmental 
Conservation, 2023b). These advisories use the EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI), a ratio of the forecast or measured 
pollutant level to a “short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health” (United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b).  Advisories recommend actions to reduce exposure, such as reducing 
outdoor exercise during times of high pollution. NYSDEC shares data with the national AirNow program, which makes 
data and advisories publicly available through smartphone apps and weather forecasts, via a partnership with the 
National Weather Service (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2023a). Air quality health advisories are 
almost always for elevated ozone or PM2.5 concentrations.  Prior to 2023, PM2.5 advisories in the NYC metro area 
were infrequent in recent years. The AQI (based on a 24-hour average PM2.5) was 100 or greater fewer than 3 times 
per year from 2010 through 2022, and the maximum PM2.5 AQI was 154.  Smoke from wildfires in Canada caused the 
PM2.5 AQI to exceed100 9 times to date in 2023, reaching a maximum of 254 (United States Environmental 
Protection Agency, 2023e) (concentrations were much higher over shorter averaging times) 
Experts have noted the limitations of an AQI based on a single-pollutant’s regulatory threshold, noting that air 
pollution harm is not limited to concentrations above regulatory standards and much more common days with 
moderate levels of multiple pollutants do not trigger warnings (Laumbach et al., 2021). Evidence shows some 
benefits of actions recommended by air quality advisories, but with important limitations. Staying indoors and avoiding 
physical activity during times or near locations with elevated air pollution and using room or central air filtration may 
reduce exposures and health risks, but more studies are needed to better quantify effectiveness, safety, and cost 
(Laumbach et al., 2021). 
The use of particle filtering masks outdoors by the public has not been part of standard guidance issued with air 
quality health advisories but was widely recommended during the recent smoke episodes affecting NYC. Some 
evidence shows that if properly worn, masks can reduce exposure and provide health benefits in some settings and 
populations. But important evidence gaps and implementation concerns remain. Patients with pre-existing lung or 
heart conditions may have difficulty tolerating some masks, improper fit or use may greatly reduce effectiveness, and 
evidence of improved outcomes is limited to short term use in populations and settings not directly comparable to 
regional air pollution episodes. It is important to note that particle filter masks do not reduce exposure to ozone, other 
gaseous pollutants, or ultrafine particles (Carlsten et al., 2020; Laumbach et al., 2021). Indoor central heating, 
ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) and portable air filtration systems can effectively improve indoor air quality during

40 
wildfire smoke pollution events, but further study is needed of longevity and maintenance of equipment, pollution 
mixture effects, and actual health benefits (Davison et al., 2021).  
Modeling studies suggest that for most people, the large health benefits of regular physical activity, especially for 
active transportation, outweigh risks of air pollution (Tainio et al., 2021). Experts note the need for more research to 
understand these tradeoffs and caution against a too low threshold and frequent advisories to limit outdoor activity, 
could have little benefit or might even be harmful (Carlsten et al., 2020; Laumbach et al., 2021).  
Equity and practical concerns have also been raised about advice given during air pollution episodes. Knowledge and 
resource limitations make it harder for some populations to understand concepts like the AQI or comply with 
recommended actions (D’Antoni et al., 2019; Laumbach et al., 2021). During hot weather, households lacking air 
conditioning can’t close windows to reduce ozone or use portable filtration devices without risking harmful heat 
exposure (Davison et al., 2021). 
Preventing tick-borne illness: Strategies for preventing tick borne illness include promoting awareness of where and 
how encounters with disease-bearing ticks occur, proper use of insect repellents effective against ticks for people and 
pets (especially dogs), integrated pest management practices to minimize tick habitat, populations, and contact in 
yards and parks, body checks for ticks at least daily, and awareness of signs and symptoms of tick-borne illness and 
the importance of seeking care promptly for diagnosis and treatment (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2021; City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023l). These depend heavily on public education 
and behavior change and should emphasize risks from outdoor activity in locations where disease-bearing ticks are 
most likely to be encountered. 
4.2 
Emergency Response 
Cooling and warming centers: Like many other cities, NYC officials encourage people who cannot stay cool at 
home during periods of extreme heat to visit cooling centers during periods of extreme heat. Cooling centers are 
senior centers, libraries, community centers, and other public places with air conditioning. Although these spaces are 
always typically open to the public, during heat events they are advertised as cooling centers and will often open for 
longer hours. During a heat wave, members of the public can visit an online cooling center finder or call 311 to find 
their closest center. A NYC Comptroller’s report (Office of the New York City Comptroller & Urban Ocean Lab, 2022) 
recommends the development of Resilience Hubs which broaden cooling center functionality to include 
complementary community supports, and the city’s 2023 sustainability plan includes an initiative to create Resilience 
Hubs (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023a). NYC Speaks (2023) summarizes ongoing Resilience Hub 
activities.  
Population-based NYC surveys indicate that there is a strong preference for staying home during hot weather, even 
when someone cannot stay cool at home (Lane et al., 2014; Madrigano et al., 2018). About 10-15% of those without 
AC or those who have it but do not use it often report going to a public place similar to a cooling center (Lane et al., 
2014; Madrigano et al., 2018). A 2021 audit of a subset of NYC cooling centers by WE ACT for Environmental Justice 
found that more signage, information, and consistent standards were needed and recommended, among other 
measures, more funding and increased community input in center operations (WE ACT for Environmental Justice, 
2021). Transport and risk perception may also be barriers to use (Berisha et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2014). A 2022 
NYC Comptroller’s report noted a need for more centers in under-served, high heat vulnerability areas, more centers 
on weekends, and more options for younger adults, since many senior centers are for people aged 60 and older (City 
of New York Bureau of Policy and Research, 2022). 
Assessments of cooling center utilization in Phoenix (Maricopa County) found that 22% of respondents used the 
centers primarily to avoid heat, but most were visiting to access other services offered at the centers. In addition to 
individuals experiencing homelessness or who did not have home AC, many used cooling centers because they 
cannot afford the cost of running their home AC (Berisha et al., 2017).  
There have been few, if any, studies conducted to examine cooling center effectiveness in reducing heat-health 
impacts. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) review on the evidence base for use of cooling centers 
to prevent heat-health impacts did not identify any research linking cooling centers to health outcomes but noted that 
there is strong evidence that staying in a cool environment generally is beneficial to health. The review concluded that 
cooling centers can be useful as part of a larger heat-health response strategy, not as a stand-alone measure 
(Widerynski et al., 2017). Another recent commentary also noted cooling centers have limited potential benefit in the 
absence of more comprehensive measures and that even with optimistic assumptions about their effectiveness, 
extremely large numbers of people would need to use them to achieve a meaningful reduction in mortality risk (Bedi 
et al., 2022). Challenges with cooling centers and Covid-19 in summer 2020 are discussed in Section 3.7.

In NYC, warming centers are not typically opened because of strong heating laws in place during cold weather and 
right to shelter laws for people experiencing homelessness. However, warming centers and warming buses were 
used following power outages due to Post-Tropical Cyclone Sandy. FEMA and the National Guard also conducted 
door-to-door welfare checks on residents affected by the flooding and widespread power outages.  
Evacuation shelters: Immediately prior to a hurricane, it is common to provide resources to allow residents to get 
out of harm’s way if safe shelter at home is not possible. This includes community-based evacuation centers. New 
Yorkers demonstrate a preference for staying home versus evacuating, as demonstrated prior to Post-Tropical 
Cyclone Sandy (Schmeltz et al., 2013). In fact, mutual aid proved more effective in preparing and providing for 
communities (Schmeltz et al., 2013). But for residents of basement apartments in flood prone areas, sheltering at 
home during flood events is not a viable solution. Additional support for evacuation center sustained operations and 
neighborhood awareness campaigns could help to socialize options available to community members. COVID-19 
created a compound risk and additional barrier to using congregate evacuation shelters1 (Sawano et al., 2021).  
For those with chronic health issues or disabilities, flood evacuation requires additional support. However, the NYC 
Emergency Management website notes that those in wheelchairs or with other disabilities affecting mobility should 
call NYC 311 for evacuation assistance if they have no other options for evacuating safely (City of New York Office of 
Emergency Management, 2022; New York City Housing Authority, 2022). With prior planning, those most dependent 
on others for their evacuation, and for ongoing support while away from home, can gain more control over how their 
health needs are met. NYCEM guidance in the My Emergency Plan workbook notes that those with disabilities can 
be taken to an accessible evacuation center, in a hospital outside of the evacuation zone (via ambulance) but will not 
have the option of giving the evacuation team a specific address. 
Household disconnection prevention: Disconnection protections vary by jurisdiction and circumstance but can 
offer important protections during extreme weather. In NYC, residential electricity disconnections for non-payment are 
suspended for all residential customers just before, during, and for two days after hot days using criteria based on the 
heat index. In 2022, Los Angeles prohibited the Department of Water and Power from practicing water or power 
shutoffs as a debt collection tool for income-qualified residents and seniors (Hayley Smith, 2022). Health risks of 
utility disconnections and prevention measures are discussed in more detail in NPCC4, Yoon et al. (2024). 
Information access: NYC has telephone services such as the 311 call line which in an emergency is regularly 
updated with information from NYC Emergency Management that can be then conveyed in more than 160 languages 
(NYC Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs & NYC Mayor’s Office of Operations, 2022). 
4.3 
Community & Social Supports 
Strengthening community social networks, cohesion, and community-based organization capacity: Social 
resilience programs that seek to increase community resources, networks, and connections, led by community 
groups or community members, may also be beneficial. Direct financial and technical assistance approaches with 
community participation and co-creation are being used. Some examples include:  
■ 
In 2017, the NYC Health Department and Mayor’s Office of Resiliency launched Be a Buddy as an 
initiative of Cool Neighborhoods NYC, a citywide heat protection strategy (City of New York Mayor’s Office 
of Resiliency, 2017). Through partnerships with Brooklyn Community Services (Brownsville), The Point 
Community Development Corporation (Hunts Point) and Union Settlement (East Harlem), Be A Buddy 
provided assistance and support to over 1,300 New Yorkers through over 60 volunteers. The partner 
organizations built and fostered hyperlocal networks to provide heat-health information to neighbors, help 
them identify community resources, and make and implement emergency plans (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022k; Schramm et al., 2020).  
■ 
The Billion Oyster Project now hosts a Citizens water quality testing site to encourage community 
awareness of water contamination risks as it aligns with their mission. The project directly addresses 
community and student engagement while also working to improve harbor water quality and reduce 
coastal storm damage. Most importantly, the project connects more than 15,000 volunteers, 100 NYC 
 
 
1 In September 2020, FEMA issued special guidance on COVID-19 planning considerations for evacuation and shelter-in-place 
(FEMA, 2020). This guidance provided a structured approach for hospitals and residential care facilities, for mass care and 
sheltering services, and for tourist populations to review existing protocols in relation to evacuation needs and COVID-19 factors.

schools, over 8,000 students, and 60 restaurants in a community science initiative with substantive 
adaptation benefits (Billion Oyster Project, 2023) 
■ 
Other states such as Virginia and Kansas are garnering attention for their community-focused city-led 
policy responses such as the Neighborhood Relief Project through which various organizations and 
citizens volunteer to help those vulnerable to extreme heat, such as seniors, people with disabilities or 
medical conditions (Maricopa Association of Governments, 2023).  
Community cloudburst planning: Recognizing that FEMA flood zones, even with updated mapping, do not 
accurately reflect cloudburst flood areas requires broader approaches to capturing cloudburst impacts to help New 
Yorkers in those neighborhoods better understand their risks. Flood warnings reach those signed up through Notify 
NYC. However, prior to and during the Ida Remnants cloudburst event, although 29 alerts were dispensed, less than 
a million of NYC’s 8 million+ population received those alerts (A. Walker, 2021). Moreover, the high volume of 
notifications may result in a dismissal of the threat’s severity and delay critical action (Short et al., 2021). Or, 
conflicting warnings may create confusion (e.g. take shelter from strong winds in basement/find higher ground in case 
of flooding) (City of New York, 2021). Cities that experienced catastrophic events, such as Hurricane Katrina, turned 
to social and behavioral programs to build risk readiness in standing community activities. In New Orleans, 
community groups organized neighborhood events in the places where evacuation buses picked up residents who 
lacked the means to evacuate on their own. Such habituated events intend to strengthen community cohesion while 
reinforcing the message of evacuation planning (Kinney et al., 2015). Similar strategies could be considered for NYC 
in concert with Community Boards or Community-based Organizations. While NYC Emergency Management 
(NYCEM) preparedness resources identify flash flooding as a risk, community readiness arguably lags. Recent efforts 
such as the Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan attempt to prepare residents for such events and to help with speed of 
recovery (City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2022b). However, there is significantly more 
preparation required given the health impacts of local flooding types.  
Smart technologies: Smart technologies can be used to connect people with information about flood risk areas, 
flood monitoring, warnings, MTA routing, and navigation apps, and housing resources like StreetEasy to improve 
awareness. There is also potential in communication tools used during COVID-19, like LINK messaging (nyc covid 
vaccine appointments [@nycshotslots], 2021), to communicate about climate risks. Resident notification about 
flooded bus stops/routes and/or subways alongside alternative routing to sustain connections would offer benefits. 
4.4 
Health Care Provider Roles 
Patient interactions and counseling: Through their relationships and interactions with patients, health care 
providers can play key roles in preventing health impacts from dangerous weather. For example, health professionals 
can identify patients at risk of heat-related illness, counsel patients and caregivers, and educate other populations 
and those that interact with them. Studies to evaluate effectiveness are limited, but clinical judgement and an 
understanding of climate-related illness risk factors and vulnerabilities support several strategies as proposed for 
preventing heat related illness: 1) target strategies to specific groups, such as general population, occupational risk 
groups, and athletes, 2) identify vulnerable individuals, 3) provide tailored education and anticipatory guidance to 
patients, caregivers, coaches, employers and others about illnesses, prevention, and preparedness strategies 
(Sorensen & Hess, 2022). Several of these strategies are included in health advisories provided by the NYC 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (2022e) to providers at the beginning of the summer season and when 
heat advisories are issued.  
Health professionals could also be encouraged to ask patients about their household energy landscape (e.g., energy 
use, protective or coping behaviors) and serve as the link between patients and resources to reduce energy 
insecurity (Cook et al., 2008; Hernández, 2018). Research has demonstrated the efficacy of connections to medical 
services for protection against energy insecurity, with connections to medical services sometimes leading to referrals 
to other resources, such as free legal programs to claim settlements for household energy-related damages (e.g., 
malfunctioning heating systems leading to health consequences) (Cook et al., 2008; Hernández, 2018). Some 
screening tools of social determinants of health have already incorporated questions about energy insecurity, asking 
whether one suffers from lack of heat or malfunctioning stove or oven (Hager et al., 2010). Comprehensive screening 
tools could help systematically identify patients suffering from energy insecurity and refer them to appropriate 
resources, such as food, financial, legal, tenants’ rights services as well as government energy cost and 
weatherization assistance programs (Hernández, 2018). 
Climate-health trainings for providers: The American Public Health Association (APHA) declared climate change a 
public health emergency in 2022 (American Medical Association, 2022), and some medical schools now host 
curricula specifically focused on training for climate change risk awareness and response  (American Lung 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
43 
Association, 2019; Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, 2022a, 2022b). Private health service 
providers are only beginning to prepare for climate impacts, however. Organizations such as the Medical Society 
Consortium on Climate and Health (MSCCH) now solicit physicians to support such training and are in the midst of 
building case studies and curricula to share with physicians (L. Walker, 2023). Health Aid Training and Patient 
Education need further attention as there are few home-health worker training programs related to climate change 
and fewer patient resources to offer guidance on climate impacts to health. Trainings for home-health aides were 
included in the city’s Cool Neighborhoods heat mitigation and adaptation plan (City of New York Mayor’s Office of 
Resiliency, 2017). Healthcare without Harm also provides applicable guidance (U.S. Health Care Climate Council, 
2019). Mental health care providers and emergency responders are also potential partners for patient-level education 
and intervention (See Community & Social Supports). 
4.5 
Interventions in the Housing and Energy Sectors 
Reducing emissions:  Local and regional emission reductions are the best way to reduce local air pollution 
exposures and health impacts. Air quality health impact assessments described in Balk et al., (2024) estimate the 
benefits of reduced illness and death already achieved and possible in the future through measures such as NYC 
Clean Heat, achieving NYC’s 80x50 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, and reducing traffic related air 
pollution (Johnson, Haney, et al., 2020; Kheirbek, Haney, et al., 2014; Kheirbek et al., 2016). NPCC4, Yoon et al. 
(2024) considers more fully the potential challenges and opportunities for reducing emissions from the energy sector, 
while ensuring affordable, reliable energy for all New Yorkers. 
Residential cooling: Ability to afford home air conditioning and energy to run it is a major driver of indoor 
temperature. Air conditioning can lower indoor temperatures and increase ventilation. Improving home AC access 
can also reduce health inequities by race and income (Madrigano et al., 2018). Some types of facilities housing at-
risk people are already required to maintain safe indoor temperatures during hot weather. For example, federal 
legislation requires long-term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid to provide comfortable and safe 
temperatures, and facilities certified after 1990 are required to keep temperatures in a range from 71 to 81°F 
(National Archives, 2023). Some jurisdictions, such as Dallas, Tucson, and Tempe, require that rental properties have 
cooling equipment (The Times Editorial Board, 2022).   
In 2023, NYC announced plans to develop maximum indoor temperature policies to protect all residents by 2030 and 
require cooling in all new construction by 2025 (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023a). Energy efficiency 
measures, such as higher thermostat settings (Ortiz et al., 2022) can help reduce cooling cost burdens, as can cool 
roofs that are painted with white reflective paint to reflect rather than absorb heat, which can reduce indoor 
temperatures (Bock et al., 2021; Y. Sun et al., 2021). Green roofs also have benefits to the indoor environment but 
are more expensive to install and maintain. Air conditioning, energy use, and equity is discussed further in Balk et al., 
(2024) and Yoon et al., (2024). 
Reduce household flood risk: Recommendations from the NYC Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency 
(SIRR) and examples from NYCHA’s and Enterprise Community Partners’ recent guidance on retrofits offer paths 
forward to help NYC residents understand what they can do as renters or as owners to reduce their home flood risks. 
Reducing risk includes addressing basement apartments by making them safer where possible or removing them 
where flooding is not manageable otherwise. This should occur in concert with increasing safe affordable housing 
outside of flood prone areas. Supporting home recovery after flooding, to enable re-occupancy as soon as possible, 
or to offer alternative housing if extended recovery is required (City of New York, 2018; City of New York Housing 
Preservation and Development, 2022b; City of New York Office of Emergency Management, 2022; Faber, 2015; 
Hernandez et al., 2019, 2019; Hornbach et al., 2022; Limaye et al., 2019; New York City Housing Authority, 2022; R. 
R. Thompson et al., 2017; Weichselbaum, 2012; Yong, 2017).  
However, as can be seen in places like both New York and Seoul where affordable housing options are extremely 
limited (Morris, 2022), people will continue to reside in converted cellar or basement apartments and remain at risk. 
NYC began a basement apartment conversion pilot program in 2019 (Kully, 2020), initially limited to East New York 
and Cypress Hills, to help middle- and low-income homeowners convert their basement or cellar into safe spaces that 
could be rented out through low- or no-interest loans, but participation in the program was very low (McDonough, 
2023). In November 2023, the city announced the launch of another program to fund 15 homeowners to build or 
retrofit accessory dwelling units (ADUs), including basement apartments, in an effort to inform plans to increase the 
availability of affordable housing. These plans, outlined in the City of Yes proposal, aim to ease zoning restrictions 
and legalize more basement and other dwellings to create up to 100,000 new affordable homes (City of New York 
Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2023; City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023b; Hughes 
& Marroquin, 2023).  It will be essential that measures are taken to ensure that location and design of ADUs created 
through such plans protect the dwellings and occupants from flooding.

For long-term strategies related to homeowner/building-owner options, FloodHelpNY (Center for NYC 
Neighborhoods, 2023) offers retrofitting suggestions that range in expense and disruption to daily life. On the more 
expensive and disruptive end, one suggestion is to fill in the basement, which is an adaptation measure that blocks 
off the area that could be flooded. Other suggestions for single-family homes include elevating a residence, moving 
critical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing services out of the basement, installing flood vents, and installing a 
backwater valve (or check valve), which prevents flooding from sewage overflow which can occur during heavy rains 
and is incredibly damaging to property and can cause lingering health risks. The site also offers more budget-friendly 
options, such as replacing carpeting with non-porous tiles, replacing porous finishes in below-ground areas with non-
porous materials and installing a sump pump, which helps remove water during and after flooding.  
The Climate-Driven Rain Response Plan, released in July 2022, is a citywide action plan specifically meant to 
address the risks of flash flooding and includes an interactive map to help renters and homeowners determine the 
risk-levels of their neighborhoods and streets to flooding. The plan also organizes workshops to spread awareness of 
techniques that can minimize damage and risk to homes, and distributed sandbags and signage at 75 likely-to-be-
flooded locations in the summer of 2022. The installation of 1,300 more green infrastructure assets is also an initiative 
within the plan, which will help divert water away from taxed sewer systems and basements by providing more 
pervious surfaces during heavy rainfall (City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2022b). A network 
of sensors, starting with 50 and expanding to 500 by 2026, will help populate a publicly available map of flooded 
areas for monitoring.  
In 2023 the city further renewed its green roof tax rebate program, which provides incentives for the addition of 
pervious surfaces throughout the city. To further research what can be done during cloudburst events like Ida, a 
Cloudburst Resiliency Planning Study is running two pilot projects in Southeast Queens as well as a check valve 
study, which could prevent sewage from backing up into homes when the sewage system overflows during a storm. 
DEP’s Wait campaign tries to spread messaging about delaying water-intensive activities such as laundry until after a 
storm passes (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021). 
The topics of relocation from flood prone areas, such as through buyouts of property owners, and the risk of 
basement apartment flooding is considered in NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al. (2024), NPCC4, Balk et al. (2024), and in 
the NYC Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA) (McPhearson et al., 2024). 
4.6 
Occupational Health Protections 
While most deaths and admissions for heat-related illness in NYC occur in residential settings, heat-related illnesses 
can occur in a variety of occupational settings – both indoors and outdoors – as described above. There are no 
specific federal policies to address worker safety from heat exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration does not require employers to provide air-conditioned (or, in the winter, heated) workplaces, though 
they recommend that employers implement heat safety plans (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2022). 
In 2021, the agency began a process to create heat safety standards but has not completed the process. In the 
absence of federal protections, a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Minnesota, Colorado, and 
Washington have instituted worker protections, including mandating that water, shade, and rest breaks be provided, 
and that extreme heat response plans be developed and implemented for outdoor workers (Adewumi-Gunn & 
Constible, 2022). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has guidelines for working in 
heat and also recommends that workers be provided with water, shade, rest, and safety training, among other 
measures (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 2020). 
Advocates have noted, however, that enforceable national safety rules are lacking and while these state-level policies 
are important, most of them still have large gaps, including a need for indoor safety standards, adequate enforcement 
and penalties, and heat-health safety trainings for workers (Adewumi-Gunn & Constible, 2022). In addition, including 
clothing absorptivity in the WBGT equation for outdoor workers could improve workplace heat protections by 
establishing more realistic standards, if WBGT workplace guidelines such as those created by the International 
Standardization Organization, were enforced (Parsons, 2006). As noted above, though, even those workplace 
standards that exist are rarely enforced (Constible et al., 2020). Undocumented workers are at increased risk of 
abusive workplace practices and may not report workplace safety issues for fear of immigration-related retaliation by 
employers (McConnell, 2019). 
4.7 
Interventions for the Public Realm and Shared Environments 
Controlling mosquito-borne illness: The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene takes numerous 
measures to prevent West Nile Virus transmission in the city. Standing water sources are removed, larvae are treated 
with biological agents to prevent them from growing into adult mosquitos, and public education outreach programs 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
45 
are implemented to increase awareness about the risks of standing water and West Nile virus (WNV) (Bajwa W, 
Slavinski S, Shah Z, Zhou L, 2022). Through surveillance data, the NYC Health Department can identify high 
transmission risk a few weeks in advance by testing traps for WNV a few weeks before it presents a risk to the public. 
If more serious measures are needed, such as the use of insecticides to reduce adult mosquito populations 
(adulticiding) then these can be identified and deployed. Requiring window screens in residential buildings may 
prevent human infections and appear to prevent sustained local transmission of mosquito-borne illnesses that 
depend on human hosts, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, and are not currently endemic in the NYC 
area (Moreno-Madriñán & Turell, 2018; Reiter et al., 2003). 
Public realm, flooding, and heat exposure: There are now smartphone applications to provide insights on flooded 
streets and offer alternative and accessible routes to move about safely before and during a flood (FloodMapp, 2022; 
Wetlands Watch, 2022). Cloudburst strategies with priorities to provide accessible pathways in critical areas could be 
a next step. Recognizing that all buildings and open spaces will not offer the same level of adaptive capacity, a 
complementary retrofit tactic is to develop accessible pathways that enable safe pedestrian movement between 
locations (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Resiliency, 2021). As an example, in Yalding, United Kingdom, a raised 
walkway provides a mode of egress/access in the event of a flood, which could be a helpful solution in areas with 
many older buildings or where flooding retrofits are infeasible due to costs or other practical reasons (Barsley, 2020).  
Messaging to alert residents to these strategies and how to manage during flood events is a critical health 
contribution, as is coastal and riverine flood management in parks, at the rivers, and at the beaches to reduce 
floodwater exposure and associated messaging to keep community members informed of their risks. Continued focus 
on combined sewer overflow (CSO) prevention is needed as these are amplified with flooding and impact respite 
areas throughout the coastal and riverine parks of New York. In the Futures and Transitions chapter of this 
assessment, repurposing space in the public right of way is considered as a strategy for increasing green space to 
mitigate the urban heat island, prevent flooding, and provide cooler, shaded places for healthy active mobility and 
outdoor socializing. 
Climate adapted street trees: NYC Parks has developed an approved tree species list (City of New York 
Department of Parks & Recreation, 2023c) for new and replacement street trees that are well adapted to NYC climate 
and urban conditions and do not add to levels of the most allergenic tree pollen.   
5 Opportunities for Future Research 
5.1 
Summary of Knowledge Gaps 
5.1.1 
Heat and health 
The effects of hot weather on mortality and other health outcomes have been extensively studied in New York and 
other cities with similar climates. Important knowledge gaps and research opportunities remain, however, and include 
a need to better understand:  
■ 
The projected relationships among higher temperatures, humidity, and other heat metrics under a 
changing climate. 
■ 
Occupational heat exposure and health impacts in NYC, including impacts on food vendors and delivery 
workers. 
■ 
Exposure and health benefits of urban heat island mitigation measures, such as green space. 
■ 
Improved data on indoor temperatures and health risks in different types of dwellings and structures. 
■ 
The impact of heat exposure on populations experiencing homelessness, both sheltered and unsheltered.  
5.1.2 
Flooding 
5.1.2.1 
Economic costs of health impacts from climate sensitive events in NYC 
As part of an ongoing Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA) to study climate change’s impacts 
on decision-making in NYC, a research team is reviewing published reports on the impacts of climate-sensitive 
events in NY from 2000 to 2020, then evaluating their health-related costs (McPhearson et al., 2024). Health-related 
costs are not typically estimated and are largely absent from climate change damage estimates (Limaye et al., 
2020).The evaluation of health-related costs will inform analyses of associated past, current, and future health costs 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
46 
under plausible climate change scenarios, which will be published in forthcoming work (McPhearson et al., 2024) 
(also see Section 4.2.1 in NPCC4, Balk et al. (2024)). 
5.1.2.2 
Location information about compound flooding impacts and areas 
As with coastal storm surges, the risk of death from cloudburst flooding during storms like the Ida Remnants 
Cloudburst and its long-term consequences for survivors were shaped by both geographic location and dwelling 
characteristics. Most obvious and tragic were drowning deaths in basement apartments. While recent city 
administrations have undertaken apartment improvement programs, and issued studies relating to basement 
apartments and subways, the deadly combination of scant affordable housing, illegal basement apartments, and 
climate change-fueled increases in extreme rainfall events merits further study to inform sustained, effective, and 
widespread action.  
Residents and policymakers could benefit from more information about the vulnerability and resilience of residential 
buildings at risk of flooding from storm surge, cloudburst events, or sea level rise. Critically important for protecting 
health is data on the locations of basement dwellings in relation to pluvial and coastal flood hazards. Data on multi-
family dwellings that have flood hardened building mechanical systems would be useful for both designing resilience 
strategies and planning for flood response. For existing renters and owners, having greater flood risk awareness can 
inform negotiations with landlords and co-op or condo boards and management companies, and help in developing 
strategies to reduce exposure. This is particularly pertinent for basement and ground floor apartment dwellers who 
may be unaware of their risks. The NYC Stormwater Resiliency Plan includes initiatives to ensure that relevant 
stakeholders know how to interpret and understand flood maps and preventative measures, as well as targeted 
messaging for people living in basement apartments prior to a storm. Also recent NYS legislation (Assembly Bill 
2023-A1967, 2023) guarantees “right to know” for prospective buyers and complements 2021 legislation which does 
the same for renters (Assembly Bill A3360A, 2021). However, for those already occupying residential buildings, there 
is no other mandate to provide information on flood-related health risks and existing residential building capacity to 
manage those risks.  
In addition to improving understanding of risk awareness, an important knowledge gap is the capacity of households 
living in basement dwellings to receive and respond to timely evacuation warnings, given the relatively limited lead 
time and spatial uncertainty of cloudburst forecasts, the possibility that warnings will arrive will residents are asleep, 
that they may have mobility impairments, and may suffer stress, warning fatigue, and other adverse effects from false 
positive alerts. As the city improves its capacity for understanding the impact of cloudburst events (City of New York 
Department of Environmental Protection, 2023c) and weather forecasting improves, residents could benefit from 
receiving such information, helping to raise risk awareness and connect the types of rainfall events and their local 
weather announcements to household decision-making and, where applicable, the need to shelter elsewhere.  
With the latest information in PlaNYC regarding voluntary mobility (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023a), New 
Yorkers could also benefit from additional research on resettlement implications of the latest climate science (see 
NPCC4, Balk et al. (Balk et al., 2024)). 
5.1.3 
Vector-borne disease 
The influences on human risk of vector-borne disease (VBD) are complex, involving climate, landcover, living 
conditions, ecosystems, and interactions among these and with humans and animals that can be infected and serve 
as hosts for further transmission. Further research is needed to understand these factors and better anticipate and 
control VBD risks in NYC and the metro area.  Additionally, improved research and surveillance can help evaluate 
and improve control measures.  For example, mosquito control strategies using integrated pest management (IPM) 
principles have been widely implemented in response to the spread of WNV in the US.  While evidence supports 
effectiveness in reducing mosquito populations, few studies have used outcomes of reduced human cases or 
surrogates for WNV risk (Nasci & Mutebi, 2019). 
5.1.4 
Mental health and social isolation 
In addition to the well-established vulnerabilities to climate health risks among people with mental health conditions, 
climate anxiety is an emerging, but not well studied phenomenon. It disproportionately affects younger people 
nationally and globally (Crandon, Scott, et al., 2022). While not an NYC-specific phenomenon, studies on its causes, 
relation to news and messaging about climate change, and vulnerable subgroups are needed to inform effective 
prevention and care for those affected (Charlson et al., 2022). Recent research describes the effects of climate 
stressors on dementia risk and those living with cognitive decline (Zuelsdorff & Limaye, 2023). Cities like NYC have 
an opportunity to shape municipal adaptation responses to better meet the needs of this population.  
Social isolation at all ages is associated with worse health outcomes and often associated with mental health 
conditions. While distinct from living alone (which is fairly easy to measure), social isolation, which increases with 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
47 
age, is much harder to measure. As such, how social isolation influences health outcomes associated with 
vulnerability to heat, flooding and other climate-stressors presents an important knowledge gap. 
5.1.5 
Air pollution advisories and public health measures 
As this assessment is being written, wildfire smoke has caused several days of poor air quality across much of the 
eastern US and in NYC. While the issuance of air quality health advisories and guidance based on the Air Quality 
Index (AQI) is a long established practice in the US, important questions remain about the appropriateness of the AQI 
and advisory thresholds, the effectiveness of some recommended personal measures to reduce exposure, the ability 
of different populations to understand and implement recommended actions, and tradeoffs between recommended 
activity restrictions and health benefits of regular physical activity (Carlsten et al., 2020; Davison et al., 2021; 
Laumbach et al., 2021). 
6 Sustained Assessment 
Sustained assessment of NYC climate-health risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities should include monitoring quantitative 
indicators, city plans and actions to reduce them, and greater public and stakeholder awareness, feedback, and civic 
engagement to spur ongoing evidence-informed actions with continuity across mayoral and city council terms. 
A comprehensive indicator and monitoring system for NYC has been recommended by NPCC in the past (Blake et 
al., 2019; Solecki et al., 2015) but has not yet been funded or implemented. For climate-health risks, a number of 
useful climate and health indicators and visualizations are available at the NYC Environment and Health Data Portal 
(City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022g). Drawing from these and other previously 
adopted indicators and coordinating reporting on those indicators alongside the climate change implications could be 
an early step. Another could be working within the existing Mayor’s Management Report and expanding the Health 
and Human Services component to be inclusive of climate change impacts on health (City of New York Mayor’s 
Office of Operations, 2023a, 2023b). Public web portals provide the possibility of soliciting input and ideas from a 
much greater range of public stakeholders and organizations than those able to attend scheduled meetings. An 
example is the interactive Vision Zero Input Map, rolled out at the launch of that initiative, (City of New York Mayor’s 
Office of Operations, 2015). The public, journalists and advocacy groups can now access and visualize safety 
intervention, crash, injury, and fatality data to assess changes over time (City of New York, 2013).  
Future sustained assessment efforts could be enhanced by implementing the roles, communications functions, and 
regular interactions among the NPCC, the Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (CCATF), and the NYC Mayor’s 
office envisioned in the local law that established the NPCC (Local Law 42, 2012).  This, in addition to NPCC 
engagement with the Environmental Justice Advisory Board (EJAB), the Sustainability Advisory Board, and the 
Climate Knowledge Exchange (CKE) can enhance the reflection of diverse stakeholders and technical expertise in 
the NPCC work products. This NPCC has also prioritized sustained assessment through the publication of a public 
NPCC website, which hosts up-to-date information on NPCC projects, and the production of public- and policymaker-
facing, plain-language summaries of their research products.  
Specific to the health sector, cultivating a community of health professionals in concert with community members in 
an ongoing knowledge exchange, deepening, or developing, ongoing relationships within communities to encourage 
climate and health conversations and to create supportive pathways to ask for help is an important shift. For example, 
a health ambassador program could offer a possible way forward. The Climate for Health Ambassador Training 
Program and the NextGen Climate and Health Ambassador Program are examples. To fairly compensate community 
members for their contributions (Climate for Health, 2023; Physicians for Social Responsibility, 2022), the EPA’s 
Water Ambassador Program offers another example (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2018).  
7 Traceable Accounts 
Key Message 1: Climate change-related health risks are a threat to all New Yorkers, but especially those most 
vulnerable because of age, poor health, and racial and social inequities. Inequities in household and neighborhood 
physical environments also mediate vulnerability to climate-health impacts. Addressing key environmental and social 
drivers of vulnerability is an essential adaptation strategy. Many current NYC policies and strategies, (e.g., improving 
access to residential air conditioning, tree planting), aim to accomplish this. These efforts can be informed and 
evaluated using data on climate-health vulnerabilities, such as components of the heat vulnerability index (HVI) and a 
flooding vulnerability index (FVI) under development.  
Description of Evidence:  Multiple studies in NYC and urban areas with similar climate show that climate change is 
increasing risks to health from exposure to heat, flooding, and other climate-sensitive exposures (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b; Kinney et al., 2015; Lane et al., 2013; New York City Panel on 
Climate Change, 2019; Parks et al., 2021, 2022; Weinberger et al., 2020). Evidence of greater vulnerability due to 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
48 
age, pre-existing health conditions, and racial and social inequities is also extensive(City of New York Department of 
Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b, 2022g; Cui & Sinoway, 2014; Ebi et al., 2021; Gamble et al., 2013; Hooper et al., 
2014; Larose et al., 2013; S. Lin et al., 2009; Madrigano et al., 2018; Meade et al., 2020; Millyard et al., 2020; Sasai 
et al., 2021). Disparities in home and neighborhood physical environments have been demonstrated to modify health 
risks (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b, 2022g; Madrigano et al., 2018). 
Remaining Uncertainties: Uncertainties and knowledge gaps are summarized for each specific climate exposure 
below. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence:  There is high confidence that NYC climate-related health risks, 
especially from heat and flooding, will increase, that vulnerable populations have been identified, and that adaptation 
can reduce risks. 
Key Message 2: Heat waves are, on average, the deadliest type of extreme weather in NYC and in much of the US. 
Even hot, but not extreme, summer weather also causes serious illness, death, and other harms to wellbeing. 
Because of climate change, NYC will experience more dangerous hot weather. Most heat-related deaths are due to 
exacerbation of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Indoor exposures can be especially 
deadly for people without air conditioning who have one or more physical or mental health conditions, are energy 
insecure, are older adults, or have jobs exposing them to unsafe indoor or outdoor temperatures. These risk factors 
can be consequences of structural racial, social, and economic inequities. Adaptive measures are needed that 
protect vulnerable populations from season-long heat-health risks, including from non-extreme but hot weather. 
Evidence-informed strategies include enhanced access to air conditioning, reducing energy insecurity, engaging 
community and health provider networks to reach vulnerable populations, and augmenting tree canopy cover.    
Description of Evidence: Multiple assessments of the IPCC, US National Climate Assessment, and NPCC state 
that temperatures will rise, extreme heat events will worsen, and support the conclusion that temperature increases 
will have a negative impact on health (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2023; USGCRP, 2018). Many 
epidemiologic studies focused on NYC, other parts of the US, and internationally have described the large, negative 
effect heat currently has on human health, including morbidity and mortality (B. G. Anderson & Bell, 2009; Curriero, 
2002; Fletcher et al., 2012; Gasparrini et al., 2015; S. Lin et al., 2009; Metzger et al., 2010b; Nori-Sarma et al., 2022; 
Parks et al., 2020; S. Sun et al., 2021; Tobías et al., 2021; Weinberger et al., 2020; Z. Xu et al., 2016; Yoo et al., 
2021). These studies often identify groups at higher risk; other studies focus specifically on associations and risk 
factors for heat mortality and morbidity. In addition, several studies and assessments describe multiple pathways  
through which persistent racism can negatively affect health for people of color through multiple pathways, including 
through inequitable heat exposure (Bailey et al., 2017; City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 
2022b; Gamble et al., 2013; Hoffman et al., 2020b; Lewis et al., 2019; Madrigano et al., 2015; O’Neill et al., 2005). 
Most heat-related deaths are caused by heat exacerbation of chronic conditions (excess mortality) (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b; Kinney et al., 2015; Weinberger et al., 2020). Comparisons of 
mortality burden across extreme weather types are limited because excess deaths from hurricanes have not been as 
well-documented, a field that is currently emerging (Parks et al., 2023). Even so, existing and recent evidence 
continues to support the conclusion that heat is deadliest type of extreme weather in NYC and in the US, on average.  
Remaining Uncertainties: There is evidence about the indoor temperature in NYC and US urban areas 
demonstrating that it can be elevated in the absence of air conditioning during and after hot weather (Vant-Hull et al., 
2018; White-Newsome et al., 2012), but there are few studies measuring indoor temperature in relation to health, and 
less available evidence about indoor temperature thresholds appropriate for vulnerable populations, for example 
those who are older adults or people with chronic or mental health conditions. However, heat stress and heat-
exacerbated deaths are more frequent in NYC residences compared to other settings, underscoring the risk of indoor 
settings (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b; Madrigano et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 
2013). Some heat adaptation strategies have been assessed or evaluated (Berisha et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2023; 
WE ACT for Environmental Justice, 2021), but there have been no or limited evaluations of the implementation and 
effectiveness of many heat interventions. In addition, there are limited studies of long-term or chronic heat exposure 
effects as well as heat-health effects that do not result in interactions with the healthcare system, with most studies 
focused on acute and/or severe health effects.  
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence:  There is high confidence that hot weather causes serious illness 
and death among vulnerable New Yorkers exposed indoors, that the burden is cumulatively greater from hot, but non-
extreme weather, and that air conditioning can reduce risk.

Key Message 3: Public health can be impacted before, during, and after flooding, which exposes New Yorkers to 
risks of drowning and other injuries, stressful evacuation, short- or long-term displacement from home, and exposures 
from clean up, repair, water contaminants, and mold from water damage. Climate projections for NYC anticipate an 
increase in extreme precipitation days and sea level rise contributing to more frequent flooding over wider areas. 
Socioeconomic disadvantage, pre-existing health conditions, and flood-vulnerable housing and infrastructure amplify 
health impacts of flooding. Adaptation strategies that modify these factors can reduce future flooding impacts on 
health.   
Description of Evidence: National and northeast regional evidence supports the connections between climate 
change, flooding, and associated health risks (Frankson et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2017; USGCRP, 2018). The wide 
range of health risks and impacts associated with flooding includes premature mortality from drowning, physical 
injuries during flooding and from post-event cleanup, asphyxiation from improper use of space heaters, exposures to 
waterborne pathogens and chemical contaminants, increases in respiratory ailments from mold growth on water-
damaged infrastructure, healthcare service disruption caused by flooding, increased risks of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, and lasting mental health consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder 
among affected communities (Hegarty et al., 2019; Lane et al., 2013; Limaye et al., 2019; Mendez-Figueroa et al., 
2019; Mort et al., 2018; Parks et al., 2021, 2022; Partash et al., 2022; Paterson et al., 2018; Semenza, 2020; 
Smalling et al., 2016; Thacher et al., 2017; USGCRP, 2018; Wertis et al., 2023). The array of strategies to address 
these risks now includes efforts to improve the power supply resiliency of buildings, developing ways to increase safe 
affordable housing outside of flood-prone areas, supporting home re-occupancy or alternative occupancies post-
flood, developing more community awareness of long-term sea level rise risks, and use of new technologies like 
phone applications that can provide insights on safer access routes before and during flooding, among others 
(Barnes & Temko, 2022; City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2017; FloodMapp, 
2022; Hornbach et al., 2022; Seip, 2022). 
Remaining Uncertainties: Uncertainties exist around the interaction of sea level rise, coastal flooding, pluvial, fluvial, 
and groundwater flooding to create location-specific compound flooding risks, since these complex systems and 
events are challenging to simulate with computer modeling. Better predictive capacity regarding the impacts of 
cloudburst events will help in evaluating localized flooding risks. Furthermore, data on the economic costs associated 
with flooding-related health impacts are not routinely collected, creating uncertainties as to the full range of flooding-
associated societal costs. Uncertainties also exist regarding the factors that can maximize voluntary, timely 
participation in flood evacuations, New Yorkers could also benefit from additional research on resettlement 
implications of the latest climate science. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Given the evidence and remaining uncertainties, there is high 
confidence that without significant intervention and reduction of vulnerabilities, New Yorkers’ health will be harmed by 
multiple types of flooding, including pluvial, fluvial, coastal, and groundwater flooding, and their compound flood 
hazards. 
Key Message 4: Hotter weather can increase concentrations of harmful air pollutants, including fine particles and 
ground-level ozone, by increasing emissions of precursor pollutants and the formation of ozone on warm, sunny 
days.  These pollutants are harmful to health for all New Yorkers, but especially for the very young and old, people 
with certain chronic health conditions, those without residential air conditioning, and those living where emissions 
from buildings and traffic are concentrated. Most of these vulnerability factors are more common among Black, 
Latino, and low-income households. Despite a warming climate, air quality has improved in New York City because of 
reduced local and regional emissions. Recent wildfire smoke plumes affecting much of the eastern US indicate the 
potential to reverse a trend of improving air quality. Efforts to further reduce emissions and exposures of vulnerable 
populations can prevent or mitigate climate-related air quality impacts.  
Description of Evidence: The relation of weather to harmful air pollutant concentrations has been thoroughly 
studied, demonstrating the potential climate change to increase ambient concentrations health risks, especially for 
ozone. (Kinney et al., 2015; Knowlton et al., 2004; K. Zhao et al., 2019). The national and global body of evidence of 
health effects from PM2.5 and ozone are extensive and robust (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 
2020; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2020).  Physiologic mechanisms and epidemiologic studies 
have demonstrated the influence of age and chronic health conditions (Perera & Nadeau, 2022; United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, 2022a). Evidence for physical environment factors influencing vulnerability, 
including residential air conditioning and proximity to traffic emissions is also substantial (Bell et al., 2014; Jhun et al., 
2014; D. Zhao et al., 2015; Zuraimi et al., 2011) as is data showing Black, Latino, and low-income households having 
a greater burden of health and physical environment vulnerabilities (City of New York Department of Health and 
Mental Hygiene, 2023i). Robust local data show improving air quality in NYC because of reduced emissions (City of 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
50 
New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022i; Kheirbek, Ito, et al., 2014; Pitiranggon et al., 2021; 
Zhang et al., 2021). 
Remaining Uncertainties: Air pollution epidemiology continues to identify additional health effects at levels well 
below regulatory standards and current health burdens are likely to be underestimated. Future risks of severe wildfire 
smoke episodes, like that impacting NYC in the summer of 2023 are yet to be quantified as is the potential for them to 
reverse decades of progress in reducing PM2.5 exposure in NYC. Questions remain about the appropriateness of 
public health response strategies for acute air pollution episodes, including the AQI and advisory thresholds, the 
effectiveness of some recommended personal measures to reduce exposure, the ability of different populations to 
understand and implement recommended actions, and tradeoffs between recommended activity restrictions and 
health benefits of regular physical activity (Carlsten et al., 2020; Davison et al., 2021; Laumbach et al., 2021). The 
exposure-response relationship of indoor NO2 pollution from gas stoves is uncertain and direct evidence of the health 
benefits of replacing gas stoves with electric ones is limited. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Based on high quality local and national studies, there is high 
confidence that: air pollution will continue to cause substantial public health impacts in New York City, especially 
among vulnerable populations and that reducing local emissions has and can continue to improve local air quality. 
There is moderate confidence that climate change will increase the risk of wildfires that can adversely affect NYC air 
quality. There is substantial uncertainty about the future frequency and severity of wildfire smoke episodes in NYC 
and the effectiveness of measures to reduce local exposures and health risks. 
Key Message 5: Nationally, climate change is causing an earlier, longer, and possibly more intense plant pollen 
production season, but this trend is less evident in the northeast. Within New York City, pollen from several common 
tree species contribute to pollen exposure, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and asthma exacerbations. Communities with 
less access to health care, more household asthma triggers, and less well-managed asthma are more vulnerable.  Air 
conditioning and filtration can reduce indoor pollen exposure. Attention to local tree cover density and species 
composition along with improved access to care, evidence-based asthma management, and patient education can 
reduce pollen exposure, vulnerability, and future allergic illness.   
Description of Evidence:  High quality national and local studies published since NPCC2 (Kinney et al., 2015) add 
to the weight of evidence available for that assessment that the pollen season timing and intensity are being 
influenced by climate change and that pollen exposure and allergic illness is influenced by local land cover with plant 
species producing allergenic pollen (Ito et al., 2015; Lara et al., 2020; Lovasi et al., 2013; Weinberger et al., 2016). 
Evidence has also grown that climate influences indoor and outdoor mold growth and that mold exposure can cause 
or exacerbate respiratory illness (Anees-Hill et al., 2022; Eguiluz-Gracia et al., 2020; Hanson et al., 2022; Poole et al., 
2019; Sampath et al., 2023).  
Remaining Uncertainties:  Local data on trends in pollen and mold exposure is limited and there are uncertainties in 
the relative influence of climate change versus trends in local landcover and housing construction and condition on 
these exposures. This adds uncertainty to knowledge of recent local trends and future projections of local allergic 
illness risk from these climate change sensitive aeroallergens.  
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Confidence is high that climate change is influencing and 
increasing national aeroallergen exposure. Confidence is moderate that climate change will increase local health 
aeroallergen exposures and health risks, which are also influenced by multiple non-climate factors. 
Key Message 6: In the northeast, changes in climate, landcover, and ecosystems continue to shift the spatial and 
seasonal distribution of mosquitos and ticks that are current or potential vectors of human illness. Within New York 
City, the spatial distribution of these vectors and potential for human infection and serious illness varies with 
differences in the built environment, natural habitat and host animal abundance, human behaviors, and population 
vulnerability. Seniors, those with chronic illnesses, and people who are homeless are more susceptible to 
complications from West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Lyme disease risk among New Yorkers is increased among 
those engaged in outdoor activities mostly outside the city, but also in Staten Island and a limited area in the Bronx. 
Vector-borne disease (VBD) risk is also increased by international travel to and immigration from disease-endemic 
areas. Disease surveillance, vector monitoring and control, and public and clinician awareness can reduce future 
risks in a changing climate.   
Description of Evidence: High quality local and national studies demonstrate sensitivity of the range and abundance 
of mosquitos and ticks to climate change and complex interactions among climate variables (Alkishe et al., 2021; 
Kinney et al., 2015; S. Lin et al., 2019; Paull et al., 2017; Shaman et al., 2005; Soverow et al., 2009). Evidence is also 
strong that non-climate variables, including human settlement and behavior patterns, and their interactions with 
climate also influence exposure and health risks from vector-borne pathogens (Bardosh et al., 2017; Keyel et al., 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment  
Climate Change and New York City’s Health Risk 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
51 
2021; Paull et al., 2017; USGCRP, 2018). Robust local surveillance data shows that tick-borne diseases are most 
often acquired by New Yorkers during travel outside NYC and that locally acquired infection occurs mostly in Staten 
Island.  
Remaining Uncertainties: The influences of the complex, multiple climate and non-climate factors influencing 
human risk of VBD make it difficult to project future risks of currently endemic VBD in NYC and the metro area.  Even 
more uncertain are future risks of new or emergent VBD. Additionally, improved research and surveillance can help 
evaluate and improve control measures. For example, mosquito control strategies using integrated pest management 
(IPM) principles have been widely implemented in response to the spread of WNV in the US. While evidence 
supports effectiveness in reducing mosquito populations, few studies have used outcomes of reduced human cases 
or surrogates for WNV risk (Nasci & Mutebi, 2019). 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: There is high confidence that locally endemic VBDs will continue 
to cause illness in New Yorkers, that the risk of exposure will vary spatially and with changes in weather, and that 
robust local surveillance of insect vectors and human infections is essential to early identification and control of 
outbreaks. There is moderate confidence that changes in climate, international migration, and habitat could cause 
cases of locally transmitted malaria or other VBD not currently endemic in NYC but high uncertainty concerning the 
future risk of sustained local transmission. 
Key Message 7: Climate change may increase the risk of exposure to water-borne pathogens in surface waters and 
wastewater in and around New York City and could threaten its drinking water sources and distribution system. 
Increased flooding can cause exposure to contaminants flood and surface waters from combined sewer overflows 
(CSOs) and sewer backups.  Rising temperatures facilitate the growth and spread of pathogens such as bacteria that 
cause gastrointestinal illness, Legionnaire’s disease, and a range of illnesses from harmful algal blooms. Extreme 
weather and climate change impacts on New York City’s source and distribution infrastructure could compromise 
water quality and quantity. Continued maintenance and adaptation of infrastructure along with coordinated 
surveillance of water quality, human, and animal health can help prevent and control quality impacts on health.  
Description of Evidence:  Global and national studies demonstrate the potential for flooding, higher temperatures 
and rising humidity caused by climate change to increase risk of waterborne gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other 
illnesses (D. M. Anderson et al., 2021; Escobar et al., 2015; Liang & Messenger, 2018; Paschke et al., 2019; 
Semenza, 2020; Simmering et al., 2017; Trtanj et al., 2016). In New York State, HAB reports increased in frequency 
from 2012-2020 (Gorney et al., 2023). Locally, climate risks to New York City’s drinking water supply are more 
complex because of its protected upstate watershed (Zimmerman et al., 2019). Local data shows the potential for 
flooding to exposure to water contaminants through sewage backups and combined sewer overflows that affect 
surface water quality around the city (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023h), for 
legionella outbreaks from cooling towers (Weiss et al., 2017), and for harmful algal blooms to affect local water 
bodies (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 2023a).  
Remaining Uncertainties: New York City’s unique and complex drinking water infrastructure and behaviors 
influencing contact with surface water makes it difficult to quantify future waterborne illness risk caused by climate 
change.   
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: There is moderate confidence that, absent adaptation, climate 
change can increase the local risk of exposure to waterborne contaminants from flooding and to legionella aerosols 
from cooling towers.   
Key Message 8: Climate risks can be compounded when they disrupt lifeline infrastructure systems or overlap with 
non-climate public health emergencies. Examples include power outages during recent extreme heat events and the 
COVID-19 pandemic creating potential disease transmission risks in cooling centers and other publicly accessible 
indoor spaces. The health risks from compound hazards can be reduced through investing in lifeline and other critical 
infrastructure and building mechanical systems that are adapted to extreme weather, redundant, and flexible.  Rapid, 
flexible, collaborative, multi-sectoral responses are needed to respond to pandemics and other unanticipated 
compound hazards.    
Description of Evidence:  In addition to compound risks caused by damage to lifeline infrastructure during extreme 
weather, covered earlier, local studies demonstrated the compound risks to health created by hot summer weather 
co-occurring with COVID-19 transmission (Bock et al., 2021; Lane et al., 2023; Watkins & Southall, 2019; WE ACT 
for Environmental Justice, 2021) or wildfire smoke (Rosenthal et al., 2022).   
Remaining Uncertainties: Currently available data does not allow for quantifying the local added burden of human 
illness caused by the co-occurrence of hot weather with COVID-19 or with wildfire smoke exposure.

Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Confidence is high that compound hazards can amplify climate-
health impacts but low concerning the burden of illness caused by the interaction of climate risks and recently

Liv Yoon and Peter Marcotullio developed substantive work on energy insecurity in earlier versions of this manuscript. The 
relationship between health and energy insecurity and NYC’s climate hazards was a formative part of the structuring of this 
manuscript. This work now is a separate chapter, NPCC4: Climate Change, Energy, and Energy Insecurity in New York City (Yoon 
et al, 2023).  
Deborah Balk, Kim Knowlton, and Jenna Tipaldo have received ancillary support from the Department of Citywide Administrative 
Services (DCAS), with the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ), Town+Gown Task Order-funded activity 
Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation (VIA) Analysis (Task 4), to the New School, CUNY and Columbia University. While that work 
is separate from this Assessment, its content is complementary and we therefore acknowledge it here.

1 Chapter Summary 
In the local pursuit of sustainable development and addressing global climate change challenges, it is crucial to not 
only focus on improving energy efficiency and lowering carbon intensity but also to consider how these processes 
affect the accessibility and use of energy by all who live and work in the city. Energy insecurity (EI) refers to the 
inability to meet, or stresses involved in meeting, household or community-level energy needs that are essential for 
health and wellbeing. Assertively addressing the issue of energy insecurity as New York City (NYC) pursues these 
challenges helps to bring this tension to the forefront of climate policy as it integrates energy, health, and social 
inequities.  
1.1 
Key Messages 
Key Message 1: While recognizing the urgency to reduce energy use and GHG emissions to meet the City and 
State’s ambitious climate goals and mitigate the impacts of climate change, actions must be approached 
deliberately, considering energy insecurity and health. Challenges – including reducing fossil fuel use, acquiring 
renewables, adapting the grid to meet higher demand, and securing sufficient dispatchable generation to ensure 
reliability during peak periods when solar and wind generation is low – can all have implications for energy 
affordability and reliability. While the transition offers opportunities for economic growth, improved air quality, and 
promoting active transport, equitable implementation, and reliable energy supply particularly during extreme weather 
events are important considerations for NYC. 
Key Message 2: Energy is not only vital for economic growth, but also for human health and well-being – a 
connection that the concept of energy insecurity (EI) highlights. EI can be caused by high energy costs relative to 
income, by frequent energy outages and unreliability, or both. Addressing EI both influences, and is influenced by, 
various domains such as public health, transportation, energy, and housing sectors – all compounded by climate 
change as a threat multiplier. 
Key Message 3: EI can harm public health directly – via inadequate heating or cooling, indoor air pollution, and 
reduced ability to reliably use medical devices and refrigeration necessary for health needs – and indirectly when 
high energy costs reduce spending on other essential items like healthcare and food. Populations most vulnerable to 
EI include those of any citizenship and immigration status with lower incomes, people who have experienced 
systemic racism, people with underlying health conditions, disabilities, or dependent on electric powered medical 
equipment, and renters, who are less able to access energy subsidies.  
Key Message 4: Climate resilience investments in energy infrastructure and mitigation plans for the transition from 
fossil fuels to renewable energy and the electrification of buildings and transportation could impact future energy 
reliability and costs. Vulnerable populations are most at risk from any potential increases in power outages or energy 
costs, which may be exacerbated by projected climate extremes in NYC, such as extreme heat, cold, and flooding. 
Equitable and just policies and investments in the energy and housing sectors can reduce future health risks from 
energy insecurity and shape a more resilient and equitable future.  
2 Introduction 
 
2.1 
Chapter Scope and Context 
Reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change, coupled with implementing local 
adaptation measures, is essential for effectively minimizing local climate-related health risks. This approach 
underscores the critical need to improve energy trends, such as increasing renewable energy capacity. NYC, which 
already has much lower per-capita GHG emissions than the state and surrounding suburbs, has made significant 
strides towards a more sustainable future with less GHG emissions and reduced indoor and outdoor air pollution 
through policies, and projects that advance electrification, energy efficiency, and renewable energy generation for 
both city government operations and in the private sector. However, focusing solely on these positive trends without 
addressing energy insecurity would be an incomplete and shortsighted approach. For instance, as climate change 
worsens and energy transition plans take effect, electricity demands will increase as we use more energy to cool our 
buildings and electrify the building and transportation sectors, potentially overwhelming the electricity grid and local

distribution infrastructure in the absence of advanced planning. This may cause more frequent blackouts and 
brownouts during peak periods of energy use, often associated with extreme weather events like heat waves and 
cold snaps,  – an issue we have already witnessed in the Texas storms of February 2021 (Flavelle et al., 2021). 
Electricity demand will also change as the city and state work toward achieving the GHG emissions and clean energy 
targets of New York State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) and Local Law 97 of 2019 
(LL97) (CLCPA, 2019; Local Law 97, 2019). These policies will result in buildings and transportation shifting from 
fossil fuel combustion in buildings and vehicles to electric vehicles, heat, hot water, and cooking appliances utilizing 
an electric grid that is anticipated to be increasingly supplied with renewable and low- or zero-carbon sources. As 
heating systems electrify, peak energy demand in NYC will shift from summer to winter in the coming decades (New 
York Independent System Operator, 2023c; Urban Green Council, 2021). As new renewable energy sources come 
online, the city and state must balance decommissioning fossil fuel infrastructure that contributes to air pollution and 
disproportionately harms low-income and communities of color in NYC while maintaining reliability and addressing 
energy insecurity. Energy insecurity reveals the stark disparities in the ability to meet daily energy needs – both 
impacting, and impacted by, existing inequities. Under-resourced communities, including low-income communities 
and communities of color, often bear the brunt of energy insecurity facing challenges such as limited access to 
reliable and affordable energy supply, high energy cost burden, and higher energy use due to inefficient heating and 
cooling, systems, appliances as well as poorly insulated buildings. 
BOX 1. Local Law 97 (LL97) 
In 2019, the NYC Council passed Local Law 97 (LL97), which amended the city charter and NYC administrative code to achieve 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The law set goals such as a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas levels by 2030 
compared to baseline 2005 levels and carbon neutrality by 2050. LL97 applies, with some exceptions, to buildings larger than 
25,000 gross ft2 as well as to two buildings that together exceed 50,000 ft2 which are either on the same tax lot or governed by the 
same board of managers of a condo association. Building types that are exempted from LL97 or have delayed compliance timelines 
include industrial power generation facilities, city buildings, houses of worship, and buildings on land owned by the New York City 
Housing Authority (NYCHA) or that are rent-regulated accommodations.  
LL97 incentivizes large buildings to reduce emissions in several ways, such as through investment in energy efficiency, 
electrification, and renewable energy. Other mechanisms such as offsets and credits may also help buildings meet allowable 
emissions targets. The compliance period begins in 2024 and sets emissions limits per ft2 that differ by type of property, or 
occupancy group. Under the law, large buildings may face penalties for exceeding emissions limits, or also for failing to report 
emissions annually or making false statements.  
The law also established a LL97 advisory board and required reports on the law’s adaptation and implementation, the first of which 
was submitted to the Mayor and City Council in December 2022. The advisory board is responsible for making recommendations 
for implementation of the law such as regarding owner and tenant responsibilities, incentives for reduced energy use at peak times 
and for electrification, and to assist properties with compliance through mechanisms like offsets and credits, with special attention to 
buildings in environmental justice areas.  
For More Information, please see Local Law 97 of 2019, §28-320 and §28-321 of the NYC Administrative Code, and the December 
2022 Local Law 97 Advisory Board Report, available at

2.2 
Chapter Organization 
This assessment will provide an overview of energy trends in NYC and New York State, as well as accompanying 
challenges and barriers to the energy transition – with implications for human health and wellbeing. The link between 
energy trends and their impact on health and well-being is brought to the fore by the concept of ‘energy insecurity’ 
(EI), an important addition to this assessment. Energy insecurity includes dimensions of individual energy cost burden 
and the potential for outages at the household or community level1. Furthermore, energy insecurity has human health 
consequences and increased financial burdens on government. For instance, inadequate heating or cooling can 
contribute to respiratory illnesses, which can impose significant costs on healthcare systems and further harm those 
without access to health care. This topic must be considered alongside energy trends in the context of NYC’s climate 
action planning as it highlights fissures that could otherwise be overlooked. A large and growing body of evidence 
demonstrates how energy insecurity can amplify overall climate impacts on health and their inequitable distribution 
among communities and populations (Hernández, 2013, 2016a; Hernández & Siegel, 2019; Lane et al., 2022). In 
 
 
1 Using data from the 2017 American Community Survey, the City conducted an energy cost burden analysis and found that 41% of 
low-income families (<200% FPL) in New York City are energy cost burdened compared to only 7% of non-low-income families.

addition, protecting public health requires that local, state, and national energy transition policies and investments 
reduce energy insecurity and preserve and enhance the reliability and resilience of NYC’s energy system. Concerns 
for energy insecurity must therefore complement city- and state-level policymaking to ensure that neither progress in 
energy trends nor likely scenarios of increased future demand result in worse outcomes for those already facing 
challenges in meeting everyday energy needs. 
3 Energy in New York City: Trends, Challenges and 
Opportunities 
According to the US Department of Energy (US Energy Information Administration, 2023), New York State has the 
third largest and one of the most energy efficient state economies in the nation. New Yorkers consume less total 
energy per capita than the residents of all but two other states (Hawaii and Rhode Island) (US Energy Information 
Administration, 2023). Importantly, per capita energy consumption in New York's transportation sector is lower than in 
all other states; only the District of Columbia uses less. The state's energy efficiency results in part from the use of 
mass transportation in New York's densely populated urban areas, especially in NYC. In 2019, nearly three-tenths of 
state residents used public transit to commute to work, six times the national average (US Census Bureau, 2010, 
2019). Given the state’s energy efficiency, in 2020, New York’s per capita energy-related CO2 emissions were lower 
than those of any other state in the nation (US Energy Information Administration, 2023). 
NYC was ranked 2nd most energy-efficient city in the USA2, behind Boston(Samarripas et al., 2021). It has also been 
identified as a low GHG emitter among 100 US metropolitan areas (Brown et al., 2009; Sovacool & Brown, 2010).  It 
should be noted, however, that in a global study of urban GHG emissions, North American cities were the largest 
contributors and had the mean highest per capita emissions (Marcotullio et al., 2013). In an analysis of global urban 
carbon footprints, NYC was estimated to be the third largest total GHG contributor, behind Seoul and Guangzhou, but 
was the 91st largest urban emitter per capita (Moran et al., 2018).   
Notwithstanding high energy efficiency, New York State has committed to strong reductions in GHG emissions 
through the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), as has NYC, reflected in the city’s 
commitment to the Climate Mobilization Act (New York City Council, 2019), the centerpiece of which is Local Law 97 
(BOX 1). New York State has committed to an energy transition through a decrease in the use of fossil fuels (lower 
carbon intensity) and the increase in generation of renewable energy, while at the same time, electrifying 
transportation and building energy and creating greater energy efficiencies (lowering energy intensity) where 
possible. Given the substantial share of NYC in the state’s overall energy use (30% of total electricity use of the state 
(New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 2023e)), success in meeting the state’s goals 
depends upon how successfully the city addresses the energy transition.      
NYC faces challenges in meeting its goals, particularly as climate change is shifting essential energy needs. For 
example, as summers have become warmer, cooling demand has increased. In the future, as the city electrifies, peak 
demand is expected to shift from summer to winter, and the demand is also expected to increase. At the same time, 
extreme weather events are increasingly causing power outages (Horton et al., 2010; U.S. Government 
Accountability Office (GAO), 2021). While the shift from natural gas to wind, solar, and other clean forms of energy 
and accompanying electrification (homes, businesses, vehicles) will take place, there is concern over keeping up with 
energy demand and providing adequate dispatchable generation (e.g. from battery, thermal, or other forms of 
storage) and the risk of grid failure especially during times when most people are using electricity (Clack et al., 2017; 
Fekete et al., 2023; Mideksa & Kallbekken, 2010; Nierop, 2014).  
An important challenge in meeting the goals is to do so in an equitable manner. For example, heat waves are 
affecting New York residents disproportionally, with Black and low-income residents more affected than their White 
and upper-income counterparts (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023b). When power 
outages occur, those in under-resourced communities are more affected than others (Casey et al., 2020) and 
currently, 311-calls for power outages are significantly higher in these under-resourced communities compared to 
others (Marcotullio, Diko, et al., 2023). The costs of a more resilient grid infrastructure and of decarbonizing energy 
generation, which will be collected in utility rates, could further strain low-income household budgets, therefore 
increasing energy insecurity. As renewables come online the ability for all New Yorkers to benefit could be 
undermined by differences in neighborhood hosting capacities.  
 
 
2 Urban areas in North America are typically more energy efficient than suburban and rural areas.  Hence, not only is NYC one of 
the most energy efficient cities, but it also is made up of some of the most energy efficient counties in the country.

3.1 
New York City’s Energy System 
This section outlines the city’s energy system and the challenges of creating an equitable transition. It first outlines 
the basics of NYC’s energy system and how the system is changing. Importantly, current equity issues and 
implications of the energy transition on environmental justice are highlighted. NYC’s energy system 
NYC’s energy system is intricately connected to the larger state, regional, and national energy system. This section 
attempts to outline the city’s energy system through infrastructure including electricity generation, transmission, 
distribution, gas, steam and liquid fuels systems, and energy end use for buildings, transportation, and industry. In 
describing the current system and future transition we point out energy-related environmental justice issues. 
Figure 1 visualizes the flows of energy from sources to end uses in NYC. Although simplistic, the figure attempts to 
demonstrate the size and complexity of the energy system within the city. According to the (City of New York Mayor’s 
Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022), the city consumed approximately 1.04 Quad Btu in four sectors 
(residential, commercial, industrial and transportation) in 2022. Another 430 TBtu was used for electricity production.

waste heat. Data Source: (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022) 
 
3.1.1 
Electricity system infrastructure  
While the electricity system is integrated with larger systems, there are specific infrastructures that are critical to its 
performance. These infrastructures can be categorized in terms of three main elements: generation, transmission, 
and distribution.  
3.1.1.1 
Generation 
Multiple companies and a state public authority own and operate 24 thermo-electric generation plants with a total 
capacity of over 9,000 MW of power in NYC (New York Independent System Operator, 2023b) . About 70% of the 
fleet is more than 50 years old and runs on inefficient and high-emitting technologies (City of New York Office of the 
Mayor, 2013b; Rueb, 2017). The in-city power plants rely primarily on fossil fuels—nonrenewable resources like 
natural gas and oil which emit high levels of pollutants when burned, including the GHGs responsible for warming our 
planet and sulfur and nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and heavy metals (Johnson et al., 2020).  There has been an 
increase in the use of natural gas in the generation system as the Indian Point nuclear power plant was taken offline 
in 2021. The pollutants from fossil fuel use damage natural ecosystems, degrade water and air quality, enhance 
climate risks, and harm public health.

The generation system is working at 50% during a typical day, when the city is able to import cheaper electricity 
generated largely upstate to meet demand (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013a). Within New York State, 
approximately 91% of the electricity from upstate is from renewable resources, while approximately 89% from in-city 
sources is from fossil fuels (New York Independent System Operator, 2023d). The entire in-city generation runs, 
however, during hot summer days when upstate generation is not available at competitive prices and demand is high 
(demand can reach 11,000 MW during heat waves). During periods of high demand, an arsenal of 14 clusters of 
“peaker” plants may be used to keep the grid powered, the number that are dispatched depends on the capacity 
needed (Rueb, 2017). Approximately 50% of peaker plant generation runs when temperatures are 50°F (PSE, 2020). 
These plants can ramp up quickly but emit more criteria pollutants and GHGs than other base load plants (NYC 
Environmental Justice Alliance et al., 2020) and are expensive to use (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013b). 
These plants are largely located in the South Bronx, Sunset Park, and other under-resourced communities and 
environmental justice (EJ) communities (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023). As a result, EJ communities 
have developed health disparities and vulnerabilities from the air pollution emitted by these fossil-fuel energy 
infrastructures (NYC Environmental Justice Alliance et al., 2020).  
Due to commitments to the CLCPA, the city is currently undergoing a transition in energy generation. An important 
component in this transition is distributed generation (DG). This includes combined heat and power (CHP or 
cogeneration) and smaller renewable generation infrastructure, including solar, offshore wind, and geothermal 
energy. CHP are found in certain large residential and industrial complexes, hospitals, and universities. Many of 
these systems are used consistently, while others are only for backup power (i.e., during power outages) (City of New 
York Office of the Mayor, 2013b). There are over 200 CHP systems in New York, with the biggest being the Brooklyn 
Navy Yard plant which can generate approximately 322 MW (Power Technology, 2022) and Con Edison’s 500 MW 
East River plant (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013b). Excluding these larger utility-scale systems, there 
exists approximately 150 MW of CHP within NYC (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 
2023f).  
To meet its goal of 70% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2030, New York State must add 20 GW over 
the next eight years, which will almost triple current levels (New York State Office of Budget and Policy, 2023; Office 
of the New York State Comptroller, 2021). In 2019 NYC consumed about a third of the State total and nearly all was 
generated by fossil fuels (New York State Department of Public Service, 2020). Therefore, increasing renewable 
generation in the city is a necessary part of meeting the State’s goals. NYC has set a target to deploy 1,000 MW of 
solar citywide by 2030. . Thus far, the city has installed 476 MW of solar generation (New York State Energy 
Research and Development Authority, 2023f). The city also has a goal of installing 100 MW of solar on city-owned 
buildings by 2025. As of 2022, 22 MW of solar PV panels were installed across 110 buildings, fulfilling 16% of the 
city's goal (NYC DCAS, 2023). 
Community solar includes solar panels at offsite locations and therefore allows apartment renters, who may have no 
say about solar panels on their buildings, to benefit from solar energy. It also is beneficial to property owners, who 
can then split installation and maintenance costs for solar infrastructure. Currently, there are 43 MW generated by 
community solar in NYC (New York State, 2023a).  
Not all communities may be able to take advantage of these technologies, however. Hosting capacity, or an estimate 
of the amount of distributed energy resources (such as solar) that may be accommodated without adversely 
impacting power quality or reliability under current configurations and without requiring infrastructure upgrades, varies 
across the city. Figure 2 demonstrates that hosting capacities of the grid in Manhattan are different from that of the 
Bronx and parts of Brooklyn.

The city is also seeking to procure offshore wind energy. Wind projects are projected to reduce NYC’s fossil fuel use 
for electricity by over 80% by 2030 (New York City Economic Development Corporation, 2021; New York State 
Energy Research and Development Authority, 2023d). Offshore wind projects that will serve NYC are under 
development in the New York Bight (Figure 3). The State issued competitive solicitations for offshore wind energy 
and contracts with offshore wind developers to purchase offshore renewable energy certifications (ORECs). There 
have been three solicitations to date. In 2018 two projects were awarded; Empire Wind (Equinor US Holdings, Inc.) 
and Sunrise Wind (Bay State Wind LLC, a joint venture of Ørsted A/S and Eversource Energy). These projects total 
1,696 megawatts (MW) and are slated for Empire Wind 1. In 2020, two more projects were awarded, Empire Wind 2 
and Beacon Wind, both with Equinor Wind US LLC (Equinor). Combined, the projects will deliver 2,490 megawatts 
(MW) of renewable energy. Empire Wind 2 is slated for a location near Empire 1, but Beacon Wind will be located 
south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket Island. In 2022, the most recent solicitation was awarded to three new 
offshore wind projects, representing 4,032 megawatts (MW) of clean, locally produced energy. The winders include 
Attentive Energy One (1,404 MW) developed by TotalEnergies, Rise Light & Power, and Corio Generation; 
Community Offshore Wind (1,314 MW) developed by RWE Offshore Renewables and National Grid Ventures; and 
Excelsior Wind (1,314 MW) developed by Vineyard Offshore (Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners). The Excelsior 
project will be located close to Empire 1 & 2 (within 22 miles of NYC). Both Attentive Energy One and Community 
Offshore Wind are located further south (located between 54 and 64 miles from NYC) in New York Bight. PSEG-LIPA 
has also been awarded a project. The proposed points of interconnection where the wind power will be brought into 
the State grid, are located across Long Island and NYC. There are also several planned port facilities, located 
throughout the lower New York State area where cutting-edge technologies, including the nation’s first offshore wind 
tower manufacturing plants, will be located (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 2022b, 
2022c, 2023b). Con Edison is developing the Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub to host the future offshore wind 
interconnection infrastructure for up to 1,500 MW of renewable wind energy (Consolidated Edison Company of New 
York, Inc, 2022b).

The city’s Offshore Wind Vision plan includes the creation of 13,000 green jobs and generation of $1.3 billion in 
average annual investment (City of New York, 2021). Across the USA, energy technology innovation, private- and 
public-sector investments, and state, local, and federal energy and climate policies have propelled economic 
development and supported the creation of millions of jobs. An analysis of these data suggests differential 
opportunities for employment by race and ethnicity (National Association of State Energy Officials & Clean Energy 
Initiative, 2021). For example, benefits have not been equally available by gender and race particularly within the 
skilled trades, technology innovation and commercialization, and upper-level management of high-growth industries 
such as renewable energy development (IREC, 2022; Kapor Center, 2021; Keyser & Tegen, 2019; Muro et al., 2019).  
However, the city has secured commitments from offshore wind developers to direct 40% of job and investment 
benefits toward women, minorities, and environmental justice communities (New York City Economic Development 
Corporation, 2021). 
 
Figure 3. Offshore wind projects close to NYC. Source: NYSERDA (2023d). The New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority (NYSERDA) has five offshore wind projects in active development, totaling more than 4,300 megawatts. In 
July 2022, NYSERDA launched a third offshore wind solicitation to procure at least 2,000 additional megawatts of offshore wind 
energy for New Yorkers. 
Solar or wind power will produce output that is variable over time and imperfectly predictable, making it difficult to 
match generation and load at every instant. Battery energy storage systems complement variable renewable 
resources; and therefore, the city is planning for battery storage and thermal energy network development. However, 
these infrastructures have not yet been built. The city has established a goal of developing 500 MW of energy storage 
capacity within the city by 2025 and 1,000 MW by 2030. Currently, however, there are limited amounts of storage. For 
example, the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services has 10MW of energy storage projects in 
development (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023c). Con Edison is about to 
begin operating a 7.5 MW battery system in Staten Island (Larson, 2023). According to the NYC Mayor’s Office of 
Climate and Environmental Justice, there is approximately 400 megawatts (MW) of storage potential on City-owned 
unused vacant land and parking lots that could be used to deploy battery storage projects of greater than 1 MW. 
Currently, 300 MW of energy storage projects have passed initial review by relevant City agencies (City of New York 
Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023c).

Battery storage has important implications for environmental justice. On the one hand, there are safety concerns. A 
fire at a battery storage facility in Monterey County, California designed, constructed and operated by Pacific Gas & 
Electric (PG&E) and Tesla broke out in 2022, which brought national attention to large battery storage facilities 
(Ciampoli, 2022). NYC also has had experiences with battery fires, but these are from unregulated batteries used in 
e-bikes and scooters. For example, by the end of August 2023, there were 108 fires and 13 fatalities related to 
lithium-ion batteries in the city, many associated with low-income delivery service employees (Ly & Murphy Kelly, 
2023). On the other hand, battery storage can reduce the need for in-city peaking plants to operate or may eventually 
replace them altogether, improving local air quality for affected under-resourced communities while still providing 
energy reliability (PSE, 2020). Batteries and energy storage projects also have the potential to provide local good 
paying jobs and workforce training opportunities for environmental justice communities (City of New York Mayor’s 
Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023b). To address fires concerns, the city requires energy storage 
systems authorized for installation to undergo rigorous safety testing (e.g., UL certification), have required project 
design and equipment reviews and inspections by permitting authorities (e.g., FDNY), and are equipped with built-in 
safety precautions (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023d). The city also is 
pursuing strategies to regulate and improve the safety of e-bike and micro-mobility batteries (Hu, 2023). 
The city is also committed to pursuing a district-scale geothermal demonstration project (New York Independent 
System Operator, 2023d). Geothermal heat pumps, or ground-source heat pumps, rely on the constant temperature 
beneath the Earth’s surface to provide clean and efficient heating and cooling, while using less electricity than other 
types of heat pumps. NYC has already built building-level geothermal projects, including at the FDNY Rescue 
Company 2 facility in Brooklyn (Arch Daily, 2022) and at PS 62 on Staten Island (Wang, 2016). The city is now 
evaluating the feasibility of district-scale systems that connect multiple buildings to shared infrastructure, which can 
realize further efficiencies and maximize environmental benefits through balanced loads and a diversity of thermal 
sources and sinks. 
3.1.1.2 
Transmission 
Long-distance high voltage transmission lines currently bring up to 6,000 MW of electricity from different parts of New 
York State, northern New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These lines connect to 24 high-voltage transmission substations 
within the city that also receive energy from in-city generation sources, which decrease the voltage of the electricity 
and direct the electricity to either customers or the hub of smaller “area substations.” There, smaller transformers 
decrease voltage once again and feed the local distribution system. Area substations typically serve one or two 
neighborhood-level “networks” or “load areas” of customer demand, each of which includes tens of thousands of 
customers. 
A substantial amount of electricity is imported from outside NYC’s generation system. On a typical day, about 50% of 
NYC’s electricity is imported from New Jersey and locations in New York, which is carried into the city by various 
transmission cables (Rueb, 2017). Given the need for large amounts of renewable energy to meet state mandates, 
the city will need to increase its imports of energy. Therefore, two infrastructure projects are being implemented (New 
York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 2021). In December 2022, work began on the longest 
stretch of a transmission line that would bring renewable energy from Canada to NYC, the Champlain Hudson Power 
Express (CHPE), which is expected to deliver 1,250 MW of hydropower energy, about 20% of the city’s electricity 
demand (Lisa, 2022). Cable lines will be installed underground and underwater for an estimated cost of $2.2 billion. 
The transmission line is expected to start full operations in the spring of 2026 and reduce the city’s carbon emissions 
by 37 million metric tons in its first 10 years (Transmission Developers and CHPE LLC, 2023). The second project is 
called the Clean Path NY. This $11 billion infrastructure project includes more than 20 wind and solar generation 
projects located in New York State and a new 175-mile, underground transmission line that will deliver more than 7.5 
million megawatt-hours of emissions-free energy into NYC every year (Clean Path NY, 2023). 
According to the NYISO, however, as the grid transitions to intermittent renewable generation and electrification of 
buildings and transportation, at least 17,000 MW of fossil-fuel generating capacity may be needed in order to reliably 
supply electricity on high demand “peak” days (New York Independent System Operator, 2022). The NYISO argues 
that there will be a reliability need before the CHPE project is scheduled to be in service and starting as soon as 2025 
(New York Independent System Operator, 2023e) and will grow over time and over the medium-term (past 2031) 
exist even with the CHPE (Figure 3). Moreover, the CHPE was already delayed from its originally anticipated in-
service date of late 2025 due to several factors, including a longer than anticipated regulatory review process and 
supply chain logistics for key construction components. These concerns are particularly important for under-
resourced communities, as these are the neighborhoods that are currently suffering from the highest number of 
electricity interruptions in the city (Marcotullio, Braçe, et al., 2023). Another concern is that if CHPE is delayed, the 
absence of this resource could contribute to projected energy deficits forcing NYC’s electricity system to continue 
using fossil fuels.

Other concerns include claims from environmental advocates that the CHPE project will impact river and lake 
biodiversity (Riverkeeper, 2022; Sierra Club, 2022) while other claims that the price for energy delivered over CHPE 
is likely to be above market rate (EnergyZT Advisors, 2020).

3.1.1.3 
Distribution 
The electricity distribution system carries power between transmission substations and consumers. From area 
substations, electricity is distributed to end users through an underground transmission system or overhead loop 
systems and radial lines. In NYC, distribution infrastructure is primarily underground, however overhead lines carry 
14% of the electrical load in areas of the outer boroughs. The underground system works as a network with multiple 
paths to any one customer. The overhead system is simpler and has fewer redundant pathways in which energy can 
get to customers. At the same time, it is cost prohibitive to bury all electrical lines throughout the city (Office of Long-
Term Planning and Sustainability Office of the Mayor, City of New York, 2013). The distribution service lines are then 
connected to building electrical equipment. In many cases, high-rise buildings or campus-style complexes have 
dedicated transformer equipment, located beneath sidewalks, which serves these individual customers.  
The Energy of Information Administration (Energy Information Administration, 2021) estimates approximately 5% loss 
of electrical energy between generators and customers in New York State and generally most of that loss occurs in 
the distribution system (MIT, 2011). Research suggests that the number and duration of large-scale electricity 
interruptions in the US are changing. The average U.S. electricity customer experienced nearly 20 more minutes of 
power interruptions in 2020 (the warmest year on record) than in 2017 (National Centers for Environmental 
Information, 2021). When major events are excluded, however, the average duration of interruptions customers 
experienced was consistently around two hours annually (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021f). More than 
80% of interruptions were due to problems in the distribution system (Chowdhury & Koval, 2009; MIT, 2011). 
In NYC, 311-calls reporting power outages are clustered in under-resourced communities and often occur during the 
warm season (June, July and August) (Marcotullio, Diko, et al., 2023). An important consideration is that with 
electrification of residential energy, the peak load on the electric grid will shift from the summer to the winter as 
building heating systems are electrified and we start to use more electricity in the winter than the summer. Currently, 
the city’s peak power demand is 42% higher in the summer than in the winter (Urban Green Council, 2021). The shift 
is projected to occur around 2035-2040 (Figure 5) (New York Independent System Operator, 2023d). As building 
heating systems are electrified, the risk of winter outages during peak demand or during winter storms could lead to a 
new set of challenges related to keeping people safe in their homes. Given the impact of electricity interruptions on 
the health of the population (Anderson & Bell, 2012a; Casey et al., 2020; Dominianni, Lane, et al., 2018) addressing 
these challenges in an equitable way is essential (National Centers for Environmental Information, 2021).

Operator (2023a) 
The increased penetration of renewable distributed generation also will pose challenges for the design and operation 
of the distribution system. The distribution system will need the integration of new communications infrastructures, 
sensor technologies, and advanced information technology that enable new system capabilities such as distribution 
automation (automated fault detection, isolation and restoration and optimization of system voltages and power flows) 
and advanced metering that stores and communicates energy consumption as a function of time (MIT, 2011). 
3.2 
Natural Gas System 
Natural gas is transported from the Gulf Coast, Western Canada and other production regions to NYC through four 
private interstate pipelines.3 The pipelines reach numerous interconnection stations called "city gates." From the city 
gates, high-pressure gas comes via an intra-city transmission system called the New York Facilities (City of New York 
Office of the Mayor, 2013b). Much of the natural gas that comes into the city is used for power generating and 
building heating systems in the city. For individual consumers, the gas pressure needs to be reduced, which is 
performed at regulator points, before it enters into the main distribution structures underground (City of New York 
Office of the Mayor, 2013b). The gas travels throughout the city through approximately 117 miles of pipelines that 
transport natural gas within the five boroughs (U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety, 2023). On 
typical days, 98% of the in-city electricity generation is powered by natural gas and used for approximately 65% of 
heating for the 1 million buildings in the city (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013b). 
The city’s natural gas demand usually peaks on cold winter days, when it can exceed the capacity of the four 
interstate pipeline connections. On those days, utilities ask electric generating plants and other large users subject to 
interruptible utility rates to switch to liquid fuels (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013b). 
Natural gas use in NYC has increased dramatically over the past two decades. In 2005, the total natural gas energy 
use exceeded 764 TBtu and by 2021, it was over 1,000 TBtu, or a 33% increase during that period. Much of this

increase was in the buildings sector, although the industrial sector also experienced an increase. Gas utilities in New 
York are increasing their investments in their high fixed-cost pipeline networks despite the growing risk that those 
networks will become obsolete due to competition and climate policies. Over the past 10 years, the undepreciated 
balance of New York’s gas utilities’ investments in gas distribution infrastructure has more than doubled, from $13 
billion to $29 billion (Walsh & Bloomberg, 2023). Con Edison suggests a continuation of providing natural gas to 
customers over the long run but at a lower level by replacing fossil methane gas with a mix of renewable natural gas 
(RNG) and hydrogen (Con Ed & Orange & Rockland Utilities, 2023). Decisions about natural gas transitions have 
equity considerations, as the costs of replacing pipelines will be borne by remaining ratepayers, who might see their 
bills increase (Walsh & Bloomberg, 2023). 
3.3 
Steam System 
NYC’s steam system, owned and maintained by ConEd, is one of the largest district steam systems in the world, 
providing heat and hot water to over 1,500 customers in Manhattan—including hospitals and many of the city’s 
largest institutions---as well as air conditioning to a portion of those customers. Steam systems free customers from 
owning and maintaining boiler systems and require them to maintain on-site steam traps and condensate pumps.  
Six natural gas- and fuel oil-fired steam generating facilities in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens can collectively 
produce over 10 million pounds of steam per hour, either cogenerating this steam along with electricity, or producing 
steam alone. A network of 105 miles of underground pipes transports this steam to customers.  
Since 2005, however, the energy generated by ConEd’s steam plants available to end use sectors has decreased. In 
2005, the city was generating approximately 67 TBtu, but by 2021, steam energy use dropped to approximately 35 
TBtu or a 48% decrease (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022). The decrease 
in steam use has been due to customer attrition, energy efficiencies and changing customer behaviors as a result of 
the COVID19 pandemic (see also section 3.4.3 ‘Industry’ below).  
3.4 
Liquid Fuel System 
There are more than 190,000 miles of liquid fuel pipelines in the United States. These pipelines connect oil-producing 
areas to refineries and chemical plants. A separate network of pipes then brings the refined petroleum products to 
retailers and consumers. Annually, the Northeast receives over 1 billion barrels of crude oil and petroleum products 
through pipelines, although some of the flow is redirected to other areas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 
2023a).(U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a). Two of the largest pipelines within the New York Area are 
the Colonial and Buckeye Pipelines. The Colonial Pipeline system, the largest in the US, can move 2.7 million barrels 
a day of refined petroleum products from refineries in the Gulf Coast (PADD 3) to the East Coast (PADD 1). The 
system provides states along the eastern seaboard about half of their total requirements for fuels such as gasoline, 
jet fuel, and heating oil, which accounts for about one-third of America’s total petroleum product consumption 
(Medlock III, 2021). The Buckeye pipeline carries approximately 3.6 million gallons of jet fuel to JFK Airport. In 
addition, another 660,000 gallons per day of jet fuel runs through a branch pipeline to LaGuardia Airport. The pipeline 
also moves 2.7 million gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel and home heating oil to Long Island City daily. A total of nearly 
10 million gallons of turbine fuel, gasoline, diesel fuel and home heating oil, 4.2 million for airports and 5.6 million for 
NYC consumers, are transported every day through pipelines from 62 storage tanks Buckeye owns in Linden, New 
Jersey, across the Arthur Kill to Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau County (Gentilviso, 2007).  Most of the 
petroleum fuel supply arrives through ports under the jurisdiction of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
The downstate area is one of the world’s largest fuel trading hubs and serves as a regional node for fuel distribution 
across the Northeast. Infrastructure includes 117 storage terminals with more than 25 million barrels of storage 
capacity, equating to 49 percent of the State’s total (Hallman & Wei, 2016; ICF International, 2014). 
Use of fuel oil in residential and commercial sectors has dropped over time. In 2005, the residential sector used 61 
TBtu and the commercial sector used 17 TBtu, but by 2021, these figures dropped to 19.6 TBtu and 8.6 TBtu, 
respectively (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022). This drop is in part due to 
the city’s Local Law 38 (City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2021, p. 38), which required the 
phase out of No. 6 and No. 4 fuel oil, and conversion to either No. 2 fuel oil or other power sources. NYC established 
the Clean Heat Program to eliminate the use of residual heating oil which was a major source of air pollution in the 
city and linked to multiple adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease  (Columbia University Mailman 
School of Public Health, 2021). This policy led to significant improvements in NYC that were experienced in both low-
and high-income neighborhoods (L. Zhang et al., 2021).

End Use Sectors  
3.5.1 
Buildings (residential and commercial) 
There are over 1 million buildings in NYC (Table 1). The vast majority of these structures are strictly residential 
(approximately 950,000 buildings accounting for over 52% of the total building floor area in the city). There are 
another 65,000 buildings that are mixed residential and commercial structures (6% of total structures and about 18% 
of the total building floor area of the city). Commercial buildings account for about 2% of all buildings (24,000 
buildings and about 14% of total building floor area). The remaining buildings are a mix of public, industrial, open 
space, transportation and miscellaneous structures (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2023b).  
According to the NYC Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (2023), in 2021, NYC buildings used 1.2 
Quad Btu or 77% of the total energy used in the city that year. This energy use included approximately 11.6% of the 
fuel oil, 78.9% of the electricity, and 92% of the natural gas and 83.7% of the steam used during that year. The 
building sector is a major source of energy use for the city. Buildings also contribute about 70% of the city’s GHG 
emissions.

Given that residential buildings account for a large percentage of the number of buildings and total floor area of all 
city buildings, energy use in these structures is of high interest. Common residential uses of energy include space 
heating, water heating, air conditioning lighting, refrigeration, cooking, and operation of a variety of other appliances 
(U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021a). In 2020, energy consumption in the U.S. residential sector 
exceeded 12 quads Btu, which represented approximately 17% of total energy consumption and 20% of total carbon 
emissions for the nation (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021d, 2021e). A recent study of the residential 
energy use in the NYC metropolitan area suggests that between 1993 and 2009, residential energy use per 
household decreased, but that this decrease was due to declines in space heating, while energy use for water 
heating, cooling, and appliances all increased (Rio et al., 2022). This study also demonstrated that household energy 
use in the metropolitan core (5 boroughs of NYC) was lower than those in the outlying suburban areas.  
Electrification of the city’s housing stock will bring reductions in air pollution (Urban Green Council, 2021). However, 
there are important energy use differences between multi-unit and single and two-family buildings. The Department of 
Energy collects residential energy consumption data regularly at about 4-year intervals in the Residential Energy 
Consumption Survey (RECS). The data are divided into census regions and averaged. The Northeast Region 
includes New York State. The most recent survey presents data on the average energy consumption by housing 
type, both by household and square footage demonstrates differences in energy use between single family (detached 
and attached) housing and other types of buildings and also between owned and rented users. For example, within 
the Northeast region, average household energy use for single family detached housing is approximately 120.7 
million Btu annually (

Table 2). Alternatively, the average energy use for households living in apartments buildings with 5 or more units is 
36.2 million Btu, or over 3-fold less. On the other hand, among all household types, energy use per floor space is 
larger for units in apartment buildings with 2-4 units. While the energy use of renters is less than that of building 
owners, the lower use of energy in apartment versus single family households remains similar across these 
categories.

Major trends in the NYC building sector include policy driven efficiencies, but there are environmental justice 
concerns about these efforts. Most NYC residents (more than 60%) live in multi-family buildings. While multifamily 
buildings in general tend to use less energy per capita than other residential buildings, most of the existing residential 
building stock in NYC pre-dates energy codes, uses inefficient, centralized fossil-fuel based heating systems, 
primarily steam, and has little insulation. Electrification and deep decarbonization is especially challenging for several 
reasons: (1) heat pumps may require additional electrical service, (2) electricity costs may be higher than fossil-fuels 
so that even when equipment efficiency is improved, utility costs could rise, and (3) insulating the building to 
compensate for rising costs is especially difficult for lot-line and masonry buildings typical in NYC. Furthermore, heat 
pumps provide both heating and cooling, which can introduce a shifting of utility costs from owners to tenants and is 
difficult to regulate. Electrification at scale will result in increasing grid demand which could lead to power outages in 
the winter. Current laws are targeting large buildings, including residential buildings, which already demonstrate high 
levels of efficiency rather than targeting single and 2-family buildings. Over 30% of building emissions are from these 
smaller residences and they house about half of the those living in larger apartment buildings. Moreover, the 
evaluation of energy uses the ENERGY STAR evaluation technique (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021). 
Including floor area may not demonstrate the same significant differences as per person. Using floor area can 
misrepresent the relative energy consumption in heating large floor areas, particularly for small households (and pied-
à-terre investments). Even if heating the large space per floor area was equal to that of something smaller, the overall 
energy use would be higher than the smaller space. A more equitable comparison, therefore, would be per person. 
Finally, it can be more difficult to retrofit (e.g., to electrify or complete energy-efficient projects in) multifamily buildings 
than private homes because of the way the building is managed, or the way costs are allocated across owners, 
tenants, and shareholders. Efforts to electrify building systems may increase the cost of heat, hot water, and cooking 
for residents, and the consequence of electrifying buildings at scale may result in increasing demand in the winter, 
when extreme weather and storms present challenges to reliability distinct from summer heat waves.

3.5.2 
Transportation  
NYC has a massive transportation network comprised of several discrete but interconnected systems, including 
private and public vehicles and ferries, subways and heavy rail systems, and a growing bicycle and micro-mobility 
infrastructure.  
Roads and private passenger vehicles: In 2021, there were over 2 million registered motor vehicles in NYC 
(Komanoff, 2023). On an average day, 34.6 million vehicles use bridges and tunnels, and 715,000 cars enter 
Manhattan. Prior to the pandemic, approximately 100,000 Taxi and for hire vehicles made approximately 315.9 
million annual trips (NYC DOT, 2019).  
Of the 3.1 million households in the city, approximately 1.4 million households (45 percent) own a car. About 3 
percent of households own three or more cars. Ownership is lowest in Manhattan (22 percent) and highest in Staten 
Island (83 percent). Queens ownership (62%) is also above the city average, while the Bronx (40 percent) and 
Brooklyn (44 percent) look more like the city as a whole (NYC EDC, 2018). 
In 2021, on-road vehicles used approximately 14.1 percent of the city’s total final energy use (City of New York 
Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022) possibly an underestimation as energy used in segments of 
trips outside the city boundaries may be excluded). At the same time, on-road vehicles use over 83.4 percent of the 
liquid fuel (petroleum) used in the city. The total energy from fuel oils in the on-road transport sector declined from 
244 TBtu in 2005 to 226 TBtu in 2021. During this period, private passenger car energy use declined from 229 TBtu 
to approximately 214 TBtu (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022).  
The city is currently installing congestion pricing infrastructure for Manhattan’s Central Business District. Scholars 
debate environmental justice with congestion pricing focused on whether there are disproportionate burdens on low-
income drivers. Studies have demonstrated that wealthy drivers are less burdened than those that spend a larger 
share of their income on transportation energy use (Chronopoulos, 2012; Hosford et al., 2021). While congestion 
pricing can have regressive effects, these can be balanced through the redistributed benefits to public transit 
(Eliasson & Mattsson, 2006; Levinson, 2010). Increased public transit and reduced car traffic also have health 
benefits through reduced air pollution, which disproportionately affects the urban poor (Levinson, 2010; Manville & 
Goldman, 2018) depending upon how the improvements are geographically distributed (Anas & Lindsey, 2011) A 
review of the impacts of congestion pricing found greater benefits inside tolling zones than outside, but there is a lack 
of studies on the relative socio-demographic makeup of beneficiaries (Hosford et al., 2021). Congestion pricing 
should be designed with clear equity objectives such as directing funding to improve transit in EJ transit-desert 
communities, which is currently part of the fund split among involved transportation agencies (Litman, 2023; Slevin, 
2019). 
Public transit: The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA, publicly known as MTA New York City Transit as part 
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority) operates roughly 5,900 buses within NYC. These buses move 2.2 
million people on an average weekday or about 678 million people annually across 234 local, 20 Select Bus Service 
and 73 Express Bus Routes in the city. All of the MTA buses are wheelchair accessible. NYC’s bus system carries 
more passengers than Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco’s systems (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th largest in the 
country) combined. The MTA Bus Company was created in early 2005 to take over routes from private bus operators; 
plans are to eventually merge the MTA New York City Transit buses with MTA Bus (MTA, 2022). 
NYC is known for its subway that operates on a 24 hour-7 day a week schedule. The subway system includes 6,684 
subway cars, 472 stations and 248 miles (399 km) of routes (Foran & Kane, 2019). The system moves approximately 
1.7 billion people annually. The NYC system has the world’s largest number of stations (CityMetric, 2015). The 
subway system operates largely on electricity. Generally, the system used approximately 15 TBtu which has been 
stable from 2005 to 2021. There was a significant drop during COVID19 (2020) when the subway electricity energy 
fell to 12.6 TBtu for the year. It rebounded in 2021 to 13.6 TBtu (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & 
Environmental Justice, 2022; CityMetric, 2015). 
Freight: Freight arrives in NYC through air, ship, rail, truck or combination any of the modes and moves through a 
system of highways, marine terminals, rail lines and yards, airports and distributions centers. In 2016, 198 million tons 
of freight passed through NYC, including industrial inputs and various manufactured products (26%), followed by 
consumer products (22%), construction materials (17%) fuels (16%), food (10%) and waste and scrap (9%) (New 
York City Economic Development Corporation, 2018). There are 8 freight hubs and three marine terminals in the city. 
The hubs are located within each borough with 2 in Queens and Staten Island. Some freight hubs directly connect to 
the national rail network and others, like the freight hub in the Bronx, connect to USDOT’s marine highway network 
via the East River and Long Island Sound. The marine terminals include GCT New York in Staten Island, Red Hook 
Container Terminal in Brooklyn, and the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal also in Brooklyn. About 8 percent of the 
city’s freight arrives through these terminals annually.

NYC has over 90 miles of rail freight track and 9 railyards that connect the city to the national rail network. The freight 
rail network runs through the Bronx and connects to Queens and Brooklyn. A separate railway runs in Staten Island. 
Approximately 70,000 freight rail cars move through NYC each year (equivalent to 280,000 trucks). Total rail freight 
handles about 2% of the city’s total freight (New York City Economic Development Corporation, 2018).  
Most freight movement (90%) is across the road network, through the use of trucks. An average of 120,429 trucks 
crossed into or out of NYC every day. At the borough level, the most trucks cross the Queens boundary (130,300), 
followed by Manhattan (125,600), the Bronx (103,600), Brooklyn (73,500), and Staten Island (26,400). The top three 
zip codes for daily freight deliveries and shipments are located in Midtown Manhattan, next to the Lincoln Tunnel (City 
of New York Department of Transportation, 2021). A significant proportion of the freight traffic is destined to 
residential buildings. Approximately 45 percent of New Yorkers received a delivery of some kind at their home at least 
once a week with the top five orders categories of groceries and gourmet food, home and kitchen, health and beauty, 
electronics and accessories, and apparel and accessories (City of New York Department of Transportation, 2021).  
3.5.2.1 
Transportation trends 
As the city is working towards a transportation energy transition, two different but important trends are emerging. 
First, trends in motor vehicle ownership and use are shifting. Both passenger car and truck volume have increased in 
NYC. Passenger car registration has increased, as automobile-ownership increase can be seen across boroughs. 
From 2012 to 2021, the number of registered vehicles grew by 52,000 in the Bronx (22%), 59,000 in Queens (8.4%), 
66,000 in Brooklyn (13%), 23,000 in Manhattan (13%) and 23,000 in Staten Island (10%). At the same time, the 
share of city households reporting zero motor vehicles in 2021, 53.9 percent, was down from 56.5 percent in 2012. 
Three boroughs — Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan — are still majority-car-free, but the share of car-free households 
dipped by two to three percentage points in every borough (Komanoff, 2023). Overall, traffic volumes have grown by 
12% between 2015-2018. (Komanoff, 2023).  
Increasing vehicle ownership and use has been encouraged by lower gas prices over the course of several years and 
Uber and Lyft’s ascendency in the shared ride industry. Uber’s ascendancy more than doubled for-hire drivers from 
47,000 in 2013 to 103,000 in 2018 (Hu, 2018) likely accounting for a percentage of the overall 223,500 rise in five-
borough registered vehicles during the seven-year period (Komanoff, 2023). Government policies have encouraged 
car ownership, such as the Bus rapid transit program that never took flight,  the 7-line extension and the new Second 
Avenue Subway together contributed only a few miles of track and curbside parking pricing that never was 
implemented in the city (Komanoff, 2023). 
Truck traffic volumes have grown faster than passenger car volumes. Truck use in NYC has grown by 21% between 
2015 and 2018. During this period, small, single unit 2-axle trucks accounted for more than 50 percent of the growth 
in truck volumes. The increase in truck volume can been seen in the major bridge and tunnel crossings between New 
York and New Jersey, where truck volume increased at a faster rate than automobile volumes (New York City 
Economic Development Corporation, 2018).  
Truck freight traffic has experienced an increase due to the dynamics of the e-commerce sector, which has exploded 
over the last decade with consumer demand for online goods surging by over 33% between 2019 and 2020 alone 
(Brewster, 2022). E-commerce has grown, on average, 15 percent annually since 2009 and will account for 15 
percent of all retail commerce by 2020. Market researchers estimate that more than 500 million packages were 
delivered to NYC in 2018, up 13 percent from 2017 (City of New York Department of Transportation, 2021). 
Increasing demand for online goods and retail same- or next-day services have encouraged the development of “last-
mile” warehouses. These structures are for the final stage of delivery, from which items are shipped to the customer’s 
doorstep. High concentrations of last-mile warehouses impact air quality, GHG emissions, and noise pollution due to 
high numbers of truck trips, the use of diesel fuels by these trucks (which emit high levels of particular matter and 
nitrous oxides) (U.S. DOT, 2023). the large square footage needed to house items and the hours of operation 
(sometime 24 hours a day, 7 days a week). These structures are disproportionately located within lower income 
communities and communities of color (Nowlan, 2023). In NYC last-mile warehouses can currently be built directly 
adjacent to residential neighborhoods predominantly communities of color and lower-income communities, without 
any review or mitigation of traffic, public safety, or air quality impacts (Last Mile Coalition, 2023).  
Industrial traffic is also important. Within industrial business zones (IBZs), the busiest truck destinations include JFK 
Airport, Hunts Point, North Brooklyn, Maspeth, and Southwest Brooklyn with seven industries (retail, wholesale, 
accommodation and food services, modal transportation, construction, and health care) accounting for 84 percent of 
freight deliveries. The exact type of industrial traffic, however, varies by borough (City of New York Department of 
Transportation, 2021). The highest number of truck volumes during morning and evening peak periods are the 
Goethals Bridge (connecting Staten Island to New Jersey), the Major Deegan Expressway (connecting the Bronx to 
Yonkers), the Cross-Bronx Expressway, and the Throgs Neck Bridge. Many of the communities in these parts of the 
cities are under-served, communities of color.

The city has under-invested in rail, maritime, and distribution infrastructure while freight volumes are projected to 
grow 68 percent by 2045 (New York City Economic Development Corporation, 2018). 
As the city intends to electrify transportation, including these new trends will put additional demand on the grid, which 
may affect reliability during periods of peak demand, particularly in load pockets where local electric distribution 
infrastructure is insufficient.  
While passenger car travel and freight have increased, there have also been positive trends in transit and non-
motorized vehicle transport. From 2010 to 2017, subway ridership also increased from 1.60 to 1.73 million; bus 
ridership dropped from 817 to 724 million during the same period. During 2020, however, due to COVID19, subway 
ridership plunged to 640,000 people, or a drop of a third, from pre-pandemic levels in 2020 (Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, 2020). Ridership increased to 760,000 for 2021, which was about 48% of pre-pandemic 
levels. A 2023 snapshot found that subways ridership was at 67% of pre-pandemic levels as of February of 2023, 
suggesting that some pandemic trends will persist into the future (NYC Comptroller, 2023). The bus system has 
undergone a similar trend with a drop of121 million rides in 2019 to 66,000 in 2020 or 46% of pre-pandemic levels. 
Ridership increased to 71,000 in 2021 and a 2023 snap shot showed an increase to 65% of pre-pandemic levels 
(Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 2020; NYC Comptroller, 2023). Generally, NYC has an enormous and 
effective mass transit system. (NYC Comptroller, 2023). This system is conducive to lowering transportation energy 
use, increasing air quality and improving health. How the transit system evolves in the future will help to determine 
efforts to reduce emissions and improve air quality and health for all New Yorkers, but particularly for middle- and 
low-income residents that depend upon these relatively cheap transportation modes.   
Another important trend related to non-motorized traffic is the dramatic increase in micromobility. E-Bikes now 
crisscross New York Streets as riders deliver goods, including food, drink, and other services. Micromobility trends 
are new, in part, to new EV bike laws. As of November 23, 2020, all e-bikes (Classes 1-3) are legal. Moreover, the 
city has expanded the number and safety of bike lanes. NYC DOT is on track to install a record number of protected 
bike lanes in 2023, to harden more than 10 miles of existing bike lanes, and to use sturdier materials in new bike 
lanes. NYC DOT will also launch a public awareness campaign on the safe operation of e-bikes (NYC DOT, 2023). 
Bicycle ridership grew from 250,000 a day to 490,000 a day from 2010 to 2017 (NYC DOT, 2019). 
3.5.3 
Industry  
New York’s industrial energy use ranks 30th among states (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021c). In 2021, 
in NYC, industrial energy use accounted for approximately 8.7% of total energy use (City of New York Mayor’s Office 
of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022) while the share of industrial energy use for the nation was 32.4% (U.S. 
Energy Information Administration, 2021c). After decades of employment losses in the NYC industry, however, the 
sector has stabilized and is growing again. Between 2011 and 2014, the city registered a net gain of 880 
manufacturing jobs (a 1.2% increase) while New York State lost 6,615 manufacturing jobs (a 1.4 percent decline) 
(Bowles, 2015). While NYC lost 83,100 jobs, due in large part to COVID19. (Bowles, 2015), by 2021, the city gained 
349,800 jobs in manufacturing (NYS BLMI, 2021). Thus, as many cheaper and lower-paying manufacturing jobs 
continue to relocate overseas, NYC has seen a corresponding rise in technical manufacturing. This includes 
computer products, mobile devices, video games, 3-D printing, and general software engineering tools. These jobs 
tend to pay well above the average state wage (Ross, 2021).  
A recent study of the city’s economy states that there are 11 significant industries4 in NYC and most are in business 
services (NYS BLMI, 2021). They include heavy and civil engineering construction; couriers and messengers; 
warehousing and storage; other information services; securities, commodity contracts, investments; professional, 
scientific and technical services; administrative and support services; educational services; ambulatory health care 
services; social assistance’; and food service and drinking places. Most of the jobs in these industries are in service 
or the tertiary economic sector. Many of these activities take place in commercial buildings and are therefore 
accounted for in the commercial sector. Second, while manufacturing industries such as food manufacturing, apparel, 
fabricated metal product manufacturing, furniture and related product manufacturing, nonmetallic mineral product 
manufacturing, and plastics and rubber product manufacturing are still important employers, they make a small 
percentage of the total city labor force; 1.2% (City of New York Department of Labor, 2023). In 2021, the commercial 
sector in NYC used approximately 33% of total final energy use for the city, while manufacturing was responsible for 
only 8.7% of total final energy use. During that year, industry used 16.7% of all electricity, 8% of natural gas, 16.3% of 
 
 
4 An industry was designated as “significant” by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics with reference to the following characteristics: 
1) The industry experienced above-average job growth (in either net or percentage terms); or 2) The industry had more than 
150,000 jobs; or 3) The industry’s projected employment growth for 2018-2028 was above average in the region (+12.2%); or 4) 
The industry paid above-average annual wages for the region ($106,300).

steam and less than 1% of liquid fuel use (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 
2022). 
The New York economy is globally oriented, encouraging the concentration of global business and other services 
(e.g., financial markets). The service sector is a lower energy-consuming sector than manufacturing. Consequently, 
New York State accounted for about 6% of the U.S. population in 2016, but it consumed only 1% of the country’s 
industrial energy (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021b).This is also a reason why NYC’s emissions per 
capita are among the lowest among cities in the nation (Berger, 2019).This is not to suggest that manufacturing is not 
an important component of the labor market. Manufacturing offers avenues for low-skilled workers to gain 
employment and skills as well as jobs for middle-class workers (Bowles, 2015). In terms of environmental justice, the 
challenge is to secure equitable job opportunities in these industries for low-income and under-served community 
residents.  
Energy policies for these industries have environmental justice implications as there are many jobs in commercial 
industries that are low-wage, low-skills (i.e., janitorial, fast-food service, hotel housekeeping service, etc.). Policies to 
reduce energy in these industries must consider how costs will be borne for these employees. Manufacturing, 
alternatively, provides opportunities for the middle class and skilled work.  
3.6 
Summary  
New York State has a large economy significantly driven by activities in NYC. At the same time, however, it is also an 
energy efficient state, again helped by high energy efficiency in NYC. The energy system in NYC is massive and 
complex, providing reliable energy for residential, commercial, transportation and industrial uses. The system is also 
undergoing a transition, driven by the need to provide clean energy and reduce climate change. The energy 
transition, however, does not guarantee that the future energy system will be sustainable, as there is a need to be 
mindful of institutionalized environmental injustices.  
Electrifying our buildings and transportation, building new renewable energy and storage infrastructure, and 
emphasizing energy efficiencies must be approached with consideration of the current inequitable access to the 
benefits, and burdens of the energy system on some communities and the projected impacts of climate change. This 
is all the more important as those communities that contribute the least to climate change are burdened the most by 
its effects.  
Electrification of the energy system with clean renewable energy, the use of heat pumps in homes and apartments, 
and the proliferation of clean electric vehicles will go a long way to reducing GHG emissions, improving air quality and 
improving the general health and well-being of the city residents. The transition is necessary to fight the existential 
threat of climate change. However, the transition must also include attention to the inequitable access to resources, 
burdens, and opportunities across NYC neighborhoods. For example, as pointed out trends in the transportation 
sector are moving away from the city’s climate goals. Bringing transportation trends back into line should be 
accomplished equitably, allowing all who want electric vehicles access to charging stations, and all who desire other 
modes of mobility the ability to do so safely (i.e., walking, biking, using public transit). Abrupt changes or hasty 
decisions in energy policy can inadvertently exacerbate energy insecurity and health disparities, particularly for those 
already marginalized. For instance, the closing of Indian Point without a viable alternative energy source for electricity 
disproportionately impacted low-income households and underserved communities through increased prices of 
energy.  
The next section provides an overview of ‘energy insecurity’ that captures these conditions and challenges and 
demonstrates why a holistic approach, taking into account energy insecurity and health implications is warranted to 
ensure a just and sustainable energy transition that benefits all. 
4 Opportunities and Challenges to achieving the city’s 
CLCPA and LL97 Goals 
NYC and State, with their commitment to the CLCPA and Local Law 97 (LL97), are positioned to lead the nation in 
transitioning to a more sustainable energy system. This shift includes a strategic move from gas to electricity in 
buildings, underscored by the city's building electrification law (Local Law 154, 2021), and heightened building 
efficiency driven by LL97 (Local Law 97, 2019). Fuel power sources can be replaced with renewables including solar, 
wind, and hydropower. Annual fuel oil energy use is over 7% of total residential energy fossil fuel use and natural gas 
use is over 75% of total residential fossil fuel use for NYC. Together these account for over 212 trillion Btu of 
residential energy use annually. To achieve the goal of total electrification, the current grid will need to dramatically 
change. By 2030, New York will need to more than double the share of the electricity generated from wind, sun, and

water to 70% (Barnard & Ashford, 2021). However, one estimate suggests that solar alone could only power up to 
14% of the city’s current total annual electricity use (Murphy et al., 2019; Navarro, 2011). Moreover, renewable 
generation projects have tradeoffs. For example, certain stakeholders argue that the energy brought to NYC by 
CHPE is not clean (has associated GHG emissions) and the CHPE project will impact river and lake biodiversity and 
take land from indigenous people (Center for Biological Diversity, 2020; Deng, 2023; New York Independent System 
Operator, 2022; Riverkeeper, 2023). According to the NYISO, reliability concerns emerge as early as 2025, as 
‘peaker’ plants are scheduled to close and these issues will increase if the CHPE project is delayed (Energyzt 
Advisors, LLC, 2020; New York Independent System Operator, 2022; New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority, 2022a).  
Why should NYC’s energy transition be approached with caution? This transition offers a unique opportunity for NYC 
to become a model for energy efficiency with a focus on equity, particularly considering the CLCPA's requirement that 
disadvantaged community groups receive 40% percent of overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy 
efficiency programs, projects or investments (CLCPA, 2019). To realize this equity-oriented goal, electrifying our 
buildings, transportation and building new renewable energy infrastructure as outlined in the above sections should 
be approached with caution and a mindful consideration of the potential inequitable access to the benefits, or possibly 
overall improvements at the cost of marginalized populations, who may be further disenfranchised in the process. For 
example, as NYC has gotten warmer, the essential energy services needed to protect health have changed, while the 
inequitable access to energy services has not. Access to adequate air conditioning has grown to become nearly 
ubiquitous in commercial establishments, and highly prevalent in middle- and upper- income households, while low-
income households, communities and people of color continue to be much more likely to lack air conditioning or the 
means to pay to turn it on (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022d; Cong et al., 2022a; 
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc, 2022a, 2022c; Dominianni, Lane, et al., 2018; Jessel et al., 2019; 
Madrigano et al., 2018; Maldonado, 2022; Mukherjee et al., 2018; New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority, 2023a; Ortiz et al., 2022; Stone et al., 2021; Zimmerman et al., 2019). While the resilience of 
electricity grids varies regionally and generally has improved in the northeast in recent years (Shen et al., 2018), in 
June 2021, a major electricity outage during a heat wave was narrowly averted, and many neighborhoods, the 
majority of which were in Brooklyn with the largest outage occurring in Williamsburg, were affected by localized 
outages and voltage reductions (Noor, 2021). At times when electric demand is high and could threaten overall grid 
reliability, utilities may intentionally reduce customer supply voltage to reduce the overall electric load. In July 2019, at 
the tail end of a severe heat wave, ConEd cut off power to more than 30,000 customers in a high heat vulnerability 
index neighborhood to avert a wider blackout in the city from high demand and grid strain (Perper, 2019).  
The urgency to transition to renewable energy cannot be overstated. The adoption of renewable energy is crucial not 
only to mitigate the impacts of climate change but also to rectify the longstanding injustices of the current energy 
system. A transition to renewable energy offers an opportunity to address systemic inequities laden in the current 
energy system, improving health outcomes and economic stability for those most affected by the existing disparities. 
However, this crucial transition must be done in a manner that considers both the possible scenarios brought about 
by worsening climate change, as well as the reality of inequitable access to resources across marginalized 
populations. Abrupt changes or hasty decisions in energy policy can inadvertently exacerbate energy insecurity and 
health disparities, particularly for those already marginalized. For instance, sudden increases in energy prices or the 
closure of traditional energy sources without viable alternatives can disproportionately impact low-income households 
and underserved communities. The next section provides an overview of ‘energy insecurity’ that captures these 
possibilities, and demonstrates why a careful and holistic approach, considering energy insecurity and health 
implications is warranted to ensure a just and sustainable energy transition that benefits all. A carefully considered 
approach does not mean a slow transition. Instead, it implies a thoughtful, inclusive strategy that rapidly advances 
adoption of renewables while ensuring equitable benefits and mitigating risks for marginalized populations. 
5 Energy Insecurity (EI): Health Impacts and Vulnerabilities 
5.1 
Introduction: EI at Household and Community Levels 
The World Health Organization (WHO) notes the underappreciated importance of energy to global health: “Energy is 
essential to meet our basic needs: cooking, boiling water, lighting, and heating. It is also a prerequisite for good 
health -- a reality that has been largely ignored by the world community” (Rehfuess & World Health Organization, 
2006). In the US, one in three households have energy insecurity5, meaning they are unable to adequately meet their 
energy needs. The three main dimensions of household energy insecurity are physical (due to substandard built

as ‘fuel poverty’, ‘energy burden’, and ‘energy poverty’, please refer to Hernández et al., 2022.

environment of the household), economic (financial burdens that high energy expenditures impose), and behavioral 
(strategies to cope with the economic and physical dimensions of energy insecurity), all of which are associated with 
environmental, health, and social consequences (Hernández, 2016a; Yoon & Hernández, 2021) (Error! Reference 
source not found. 6). The context for energy insecurity’s influence on health in NYC and in the US is different from 
that in countries where many lack access to reliable, modern energy services for basic needs (IEA et al., 2022). In 
countries with more extensive physical infrastructure and for many decades in the US, widely available household 
energy services have provided telecommunications, refrigeration, air conditioning, and plumbed hot water. However, 
even when these appliances are available, not everyone may be able to access or use them. For example, if a 
household owns an air conditioner but cannot afford to run it, its health benefits will not be realized, and negative 
health impacts could occur (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023a). Researchers have 
also recognized that more widespread adoption of AC will further increase electricity demand (see NPCC4, Balk et al 
(Balk et al., 2024), and so policies to expand air conditioning ownership and use could also be accompanied by 
measures to reduce the need to use AC in both residential and commercial buildings.  Households may also 
experience utility disconnections for non-payment, which can be life threatening (Haag, 2018). In the context of 
climate change impacts on vulnerable US populations, the need for more research and interventions to address 
energy insecurity has long been recognized (Hernández, 2013).

This assessment also considers community-level energy insecurity in NYC, meaning energy infrastructure and 
energy services in buildings that do not reliably meet essential community needs. Analogous to household energy 
insecurity, community energy insecurity has physical, economic, and behavioral dimensions. These relate,

Interim Report for Public Release 
22 
respectively, to the physical robustness of the energy supply, local distribution infrastructure, and vulnerability to 
outages caused by extreme weather or equipment failure; the economic dimensions of energy markets and 
regulations that affect the distribution of costs among energy uses and communities; and behavioral factors that 
influence energy consumption, costs, and reliability at the community level. 
For under-resourced NYC households and communities, energy insecurity often reflects not a lack of access, but 
high cost burden, inefficient housing and appliances, and infrastructure prone to outages (Hernández, 2018; 
Hernández & Siegel, 2019; Kontokosta et al., 2020) - despite living in a state and country where most have had 
modern, affordable energy for generations.  
Research about household and community-level energy insecurity and its implications for health is still developing. 
More information on the national and international dimensions of energy insecurity and power outages can be found 
in some recent scholarly reviews which helped inform this assessment (Casey et al., 2020; Hernández, 2016a; 
Hernández & Siegel, 2019; Jessel et al., 2019). More on the global and historical context of energy insecurity is 
Annex A. 
5.2 
What Are the Health Impacts of EI In New York City? 
5.2.1 
Household EI 
Essential daily life activities such as cooking food, lighting a home, staying warm in the winter and cool in the 
summer, and sleeping and working in adequate thermal comfort are only possible when a household is energy 
secure. A compromise to any of these activities brings health consequences.  
Inadequate heat is one of the leading causes of 311 calls from low-income communities across the city (Donavan, 
2022; Office of the New York City Comptroller, 2023). Living in a cold home has pervasive adverse health effects for 
people of all ages, including respiratory problems in children, arthritis and rheumatism, and mental health challenges 
(Dear & McMichael, 2011) as well as indirect long-term effects such as negatively affecting educational attainment, 
emotional resilience, and forcing nutritional and other compromises to alleviate the financial burden of heating a 
poorly insulated home (University College et al., 2011). Energy insecurity is associated with household food 
insecurity, and for children, poorer overall health and greater risks of developmental problems and hospitalizations 
(Cook et al., 2008).   
Locally, a study in Washington Heights found that energy insecurity was significantly associated with poor respiratory 
health (e.g., asthma, pneumonia), mental health, and sleep outcomes (Hernández & Siegel, 2019). Energy Insecurity 
may harm respiratory health through coping mechanisms such as using gas stoves for heat, releasing indoor air 
pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide and potentially deadly carbon monoxide. Candles (Schwirtz & Vadukul, 2013), 
stoves, and space heaters create fire risks. Heating equipment is the leading national cause of home fires (R. 
Campbell, 2021); a malfunctioning space heater ignited a devastating Bronx apartment fire in January 2022, killing 17 
New Yorkers (Hernández, 2022). A study of low-income households in the South Bronx showed the complex ways 
energy insecurity interacts with other factors to harm health; overlapping economic hardship, poor quality housing, 
and physical health challenges contributed to stress and coping behaviors that increased cost and exacerbated 
stress (Hernández et al., 2016). 
Energy insecurity is a national issue that has received growing media attention in recent decades, often associated 
with climate change coverage, considering adverse health impacts from both extreme heat as it was with extreme 
cold, and variation in emphasis by region (Yoon & Hernández, 2021). 
5.2.2 
Community EI: power outages 
In the 2021-2022 heat season (October 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022), utility outages, including power, gas and water, 
have increased to 3605 compared to 2872 from the previous heat season (Cerro, 2023). Whether caused by extreme 
weather events, infrastructure failures, or inadequate supply, utility outages have adverse and deadly health impacts. 
For example, prolonged gas outages in NYCHA complexes in Red Hook forced residents to forego meals or spend 
hundreds of dollars on take-out food on already tight budgets (Sandoval, 2021). While all utility outages can have 
adverse health impacts, most prominently researched among them are power outages. An August 2003 blackout 
affecting the northeast – during warm but not extremely hot weather – and lasting less than two days, caused a 25% 
increase for non-accidental cause deaths and an overall increase of 28%, or roughly 90 excess deaths in NYC alone 
(Anderson & Bell, 2012b).  
Hurricane Maria likely caused more than 5,000 excess deaths in Puerto Rico during the months after storm impact; 
massive infrastructure damage, a prolonged lack of access to electricity, and interruption of medical care caused 
many more deaths than the official direct count of 64 (Kishore et al., 2018). On average, households went 84 days 
without electricity, which had wide detrimental impacts, such as the inability to use medical equipment that required

23 
electricity (Kishore et al., 2018). These large-scale power outages highlight all the more the existing environmental 
justice issues disproportionately burdening certain communities, such as those experiencing economic hardship, 
chronic health conditions, and rural populations (Andrade et al., 2022; Niles & Contreras, 2019).  
The Texas power outage of February 2021 – the worst in the state’s history – demonstrated how deadly cold weather 
blackouts can be (while also illustrating aspects unique to the Texas system, such as energy landscape and housing 
infrastructure). An initial estimate of deaths directly caused by the outage – 246 (Hellerstedt, 2021) – was much lower 
than a more complete estimate of 702 excess deaths (Aldous et al., 2021; Buchele, 2022). NYC’s very different 
housing stock would mitigate some of the risks faced in Texas and amplify others. For example, while carbon 
monoxide (CO) poisoning from portable generator use constitutes the majority of adverse health outcomes linked to 
power outage (Johnson-Arbor et al., 2014; Worsham et al., 2022), NYC may see less CO poisoning and cold-related 
mortality as high-density multi-unit residential building residents are less likely to have, and run, a portable generator 
and are better able to retain heat during a power outage (Urban Green Council, 2014). However, urban dwellers – 
particularly the elderly, the chronically ill and the poor – nevertheless face challenges in accessing safe, backup 
power (Mango et al., 2021). 
In addition to deaths from widespread outages, a range of health outcomes have been linked to power outages of 
various sizes. Limitations of available data on small outages likely mean health impacts are missed or 
underestimated. Nonetheless, localized power outages in NYC were associated with increased mortality from all 
causes and with more cardiovascular disease hospital admissions when they occurred during cold weather and with 
renal disease hospitalizations during the warm season (Dominianni, Lane, et al., 2018). Power outages in New York 
State have been linked to increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalizations, gastrointestinal 
illness (Marx et al., 2006), respiratory illness (Prezant et al., 2005), and food and water-borne diseases, comorbidity 
and medical costs (Lin et al., 2021; W. Zhang et al., 2020). One review found evidence that power outages of various 
scales can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, temperature-related illness, gastrointestinal illness, as well as 
increases in natural cause mortality and hospitalizations (Casey et al., 2020). Following Super Storm Sandy, there 
was a large increase in calls to the New York poison center for carbon monoxide poisoning, with indoor grilling and 
generator use accounting for a substantial share of cases (Chen et al., 2013). This and other power outage-related 
exposures may have contributed to excess mortality in the weeks following the storm, which increased up to 30% 
compared to the same period in 2010-2011 (Howland et al., 2015). 
5.2.3 
Individual and social vulnerability  
5.2.3.1 
Household energy insecurity 
Energy insecurity has been recognized as a ‘mediator’ between structural conditions of disadvantage, environmental 
exposures, and poor health (Figure 7) (Hernández, 2016a; Jessel et al., 2019). Individual, social, and physical 
environmental factors all influence one’s ability to access and afford essential energy. Energy insecurity 
disproportionately affects those marginalized along race and class lines through mediating factors of poverty, 
discrimination, and structural neglect resulting from a history of segregation, redlining, and housing disinvestment 
(Lewis et al., 2019). Economic and social barriers to investment in housing and energy efficiency contribute to 
disproportionate energy cost burdens for people of color across income levels. Those with disabilities or existing 
conditions that necessitate reliance on electric medical equipment are also rendered at disproportionate risk 
(Friedman, 2022). As such, many face intersecting and compounding burdens, such as those with worse baseline or 
lack of access to healthcare who are unable to refrigerate their medication during a power outage (Mango et al., 
2021).

Figure 7. Connection Between Household Energy Insecurity (EI) and Health. Source: (Jessel et al., 2019, fig. 2) 
Strong associations of social and economic disadvantage with energy insecurity are consistent; absolute estimates 
can vary with definitions and methods. Nationally, energy insecurity is patterned by socioeconomic status, race, age, 
and housing condition (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020); 82% of those 50% under the federal poverty 
line experience energy insecurity (Hernández et al., 2014). Energy insecurity is more common among Black and 
Hispanic households compared to white households, households with young children, those with a person using an 
electronic medical device, and low-income households - all for whom disparities were exacerbated by the COVID-19 
pandemic (Memmott et al., 2021). Additionally, energy insecurity is more prevalent among renters than owners, and 
Black and Hispanic New Yorkers are also overrepresented in rental units (City of New York, 2018; Lyubich, 2020). 
Lyubich (2020) found that Black households spend more in energy expenditures in absolute terms than white 
households in the U.S., even after controlling for income, household size, homeowner status, home type, and city of 
residence. A recent study of two U.S. cities found a racial effect distinct from income, with non-white city block groups 
in the lowest-income stratum reporting about 40% higher annual energy costs than block groups with more white 
residents (Tong et al., 2021). 
The unequal burden of energy insecurity is also seen in NYC, where an estimated 18% of residents were energy cost 
burdened in 2017, paying significantly more than the Governor's commitment to ‘no more than 6% of household 
income going towards energy bills’ (NYC Mayor’s Office of Sustainability & Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 
2019). In New York State, households in the lowest quintile (20%) of income spend an average of 9.5% of pretax 
income on home energy and nearly 18% when vehicle fuel and public transit costs are included. This compares to 
just 1.5% and 4% of pre-tax income, respectively, for the most affluent (top 20%) of households (Figure 8) of pre-tax 
household income, by income quintile (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021).

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022a). 
The NYC housing code sets standards for indoor temperature during the heating season, but inadequate heat is one 
of the most common reasons for calling 311. Such complaints rose 25% between October 1st, 2022 to January 10th, 
2023 and are most frequent in low-income communities of the Bronx, Northern Manhattan, and parts of Brooklyn 
(RentHop, 2023). While there are no existing requirements around cooling in summer, PlaNYC 2023 sets out an 
agenda to establish a maximum indoor temperature policy during summer months (City of New York Office of the 
Mayor, 2023).  
Utility disconnections are more common in the Northeast than other regions of the US (Hernández & Laird, 2021). 
Currently, New York State only offers protection from utility disconnection from November 1 to April 15 when there is 
a threat of hypothermia, but no statewide equivalent exists during the summer months (National Center for 
Appropriate Technology, 2022). In NYC, electric service for any residential customer may not be disconnected for 
non-payment just before, during, and for two days after hot days using the 90°F heat index criteria, and on any day 
with a minimum windchill reaching 32°F or lower (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental 
Justice, 2023c).  
Among a sample of primarily low-income and older New Yorkers in NYC, Black New Yorkers were nearly three times 
more likely to experience disconnections than non-Latinx white New Yorkers (Lane et al., 2022). They are also more 
likely to face the ‘heat or eat’ dilemma, having to choose between spending on essential food and medicine and 
paying their energy bills (Bansah et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2008), and to cope by using the stove or oven for heat. For 
vulnerable populations, power disconnections can be especially deadly. For example, 68-year-old New Jersey 
woman Linda Daniels – who was on an electric-powered oxygen tank she used to breathe – died after Public Service 
Electric and Gas Company shut off her power (Haag, 2018).  
5.2.3.2 
Power outages 
Power outages, like power disconnections experienced by households with energy insecurity, are life threatening for 
vulnerable people that depend on electric-powered medical devices (Casey et al., 2020), have health conditions that 
are exacerbated by heat or cold stress, take medications requiring refrigeration, have mobility limitations, or need 
help with daily activities. 7.6% of all NYC households use electric medical equipment, with the figure as high as 16% 
in some low-income and racialized neighborhoods such as East Harlem (City of New York Department of Health and 
Mental Hygiene, 2022c, 2023c). Following Super Storm Sandy, when power was out for much of lower Manhattan, 
ED visits and hospital admission at a nearby hospital that remained open increased the most among older patients 
(Gotanda et al., 2015). Among older adults (≥ 65 years) in NYC, and study respondents with household members 
who require assistance with daily activities or depend on electric medical devices, only 58% reported being prepared 
for an outage and only 40% those with electric-dependent medical equipment reported being enrolled in the power 
outage notification program (Dominianni, Ahmed, et al., 2018), a service offered by Con Ed and other energy utilities. 
Residents of facilities like nursing homes are nearly all at risk from power outages if backup systems fail or if outages

Interim Report for Public Release 
26 
occur during extreme heat. Backup systems are currently not required to be powerful enough to run air conditioning, 
presenting an additional layer of risk during extreme heat events. 
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida as a category 4 storm. The storm caused extensive 
damage, including leaving 6.7 million utility customers without power (Issa et al., 2018; State of Florida Division of 
Emergency Management, 2017). Local health officials documented at least 17 heat stress deaths among people who 
lacked air conditioning, of which 14 were residents of a nursing home that was unable to run its air conditioning 
because of the outages (Dosa et al., 2020; Issa et al., 2018). Outdoor temperatures were in the 80s and heat indices 
in the mid-90s but conditions inside the nursing home were much hotter and the facility could not maintain the 
federally required safe temperature maximums without air conditioning (Dosa et al., 2020; Minority Staff of the US 
Senate Committee on Finance, 2018). A study of nearly 55,000 Florida nursing home residents found that power 
outages were associated with increased odds of death at one week and at 30 days following the storm (Williams, 
2019). In addition to the deaths, more than 200 residents were evacuated and treated for dehydration and heat‐
related illnesses (Minority Staff of the US Senate Committee on Finance, 2018). Following Irma, Florida passed a law 
requiring nursing homes and assisted living facilities to have generators that can keep comfortable temperatures for 
four days after power loss (Walters, 2018).  
5.2.4 
Physical environment factors 
5.2.4.1 
Household energy insecurity 
Energy, the built environment, and health are connected, all of which influence and are influenced by social inequities 
(Hernández, 2013). Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with substandard housing conditions, such as: having 
cold drafts through holes and cracks; leaks and mold; and malfunctioning heating and cooling sources and cooking 
appliances – all of which leads to inefficient energy use and increased costs. Energy insecurity plays a key role in 
pathways linking housing deficiencies, economic hardship, health, and chronic stress (See Figure 9). Physical 
environment and energy insecurity linkages are further echoed in studies that identify older, substandard, and 
inefficient housing as a leading contributor to energy insecurity in the US and disproportionate impacts on Black 
Americans and others marginalized by race and income (Dubois, 2012; Hernández & Siegel, 2019; Memmott et al., 
2021; Min et al., 2010; Reames, 2016b; Santamouris et al., 2007). High energy costs or compromised ability to meet 
daily energy needs, in turn lead to adverse physical and mental health outcomes (Lewis et al., 2019). 
 
 
Figure 9. Housing, energy and health pathways to stress. Source: (Hernández et al., 2016, fig. 1) 
Locally, a study in the Washington Heights neighborhood found that energy insecurity was not limited to the lowest-
income households (annual household incomes ≤ $20,000); nearly 25% of those who earn $60,000-$80,000 annually 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

27 
experienced energy insecurity at least episodically (Hernández & Siegel, 2019). Renters face particular challenges 
and may have limited ability to regulate indoor temperature or cope with older appliance failures. They may 
experience high rent burdens as rising energy costs for heat and hot water are priced into rents and considered in 
affordable housing rent regulation, compounded by COVID-related price hikes and other subsequent financial 
burdens (Rent Guidelines Board | City of New York, 2019). 
Among housing types, for a given household income, average energy cost and cost burden is substantially higher in 
single family homes than it is for units within multi-family buildings (US Department of Energy Office of State and 
Community Energy Programs, 2022). Single family homes may be less able to retain heat during a cold weather 
power outage (Urban Green Council, 2014). Although relatively infrequent in NYC, cold-related (i.e. hypothermia) 
deaths with indoor exposures occur and are likely linked to being unable to pay for home heating. Most of these 
deaths involve people aged 60 or older, with mental health or cognitive conditions who live in single family or row 
homes, all without heat (Lane et al., 2018). 
Other health and climate risks can be compounded by energy insecurity. Environmental justice neighborhoods in 
particular are already dealing with these interacting exposures. For example, residents who live in the Mott Haven-
Port Morris area of the South Bronx face a variety of environmental and health challenges such as poor housing 
quality, air pollution health impacts, multiple climate risks, and a high prevalence of health conditions that make 
people more vulnerable (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022a). 
A lack of access to household air conditioning is another important dimension of energy insecurity. In NYC, between 
2012 and 2021, all heat stroke deaths among people exposed at home did not have air conditioning or were not using 
it (City of New York Environment and Health Data Portal, 2023). Households in low-income communities, and non-
Hispanic Black people are more likely to lack air conditioning or report being unable to pay the added electricity cost 
(City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022d; Lane et al., 2014; Madrigano et al., 2018) (City 
of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b). Air conditioning and other cooling technologies are 
considered in more depth in Section 6.1. Data on adults with air conditioners (City of New York Environment and 
Health Data Portal, 2007), household air conditioning (City of New York Environment and Health Data Portal, 2017) 
and older adults with air conditioners (City of New York Environment and Health Data Portal, 2013) by boroughs are 
available on the Environmental and Health Data Portal.  
5.2.4.2 
Power outages 
Power outages in NYC disproportionately affect marginalized communities, as shown by ConEd data (Figure 10). 
From 2017 through 2021, networks with more outages appear to have disproportionately impacted environmental 
justice neighborhoods (defined using the Climate Justice Working Group’s draft disadvantaged community criteria) in 
the outer boroughs.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. Case 22-E-0064 and Case 22-G-0065, 2022). 
Calls to 311 for power outages from 2014 through 2022 (NYC311, 2023) during the summer rise sharply on 
extremely hot days. Their spatial distribution is largely consistent with the outage data. Power outage calls were most 
frequent in neighborhoods in northern Manhattan, much of the Bronx, central Brooklyn, and other places with more 
low income, Black or Hispanic households (Figure 11). More details on an analysis of 311 calls for power outages 
and their relationship to weather, neighborhood demographics, energy cost burden and heat health risks are in Annex

Assessing how infrastructure influences these disparities is beyond the scope of this assessment. But the findings 
call for the need to prioritize investments in grid- and building-level resilience measures in the most vulnerable 
neighborhoods. As NYC addresses its climate change mitigation and energy transition ambitions, there will be a 
growing need for technology and infrastructure that can improve efficiency and reliability for all communities. This 
challenge is discussed in more detail below, in NPCC4, Balk et al (Balk et al., 2024), as well as in Annex C.  
6 Reducing Future Impacts 
6.1 
Current Policies 
In the near term, energy insecurity and its health impacts can be reduced through a range of strategies: direct, need-
based, subsidies for energy costs and home energy efficiency improvements; reducing energy prices; considerations 
for building codes; targeted investments in clean energy infrastructure and backup energy systems within NYC; and 
community-led renewable energy programs. The provision of subsidies and reductions in electricity rates would have 
to be undertaken at the state level by the Public Service Commission. The strength of evidence supporting 
effectiveness of different implementation approaches varies, but proven approaches can be expanded, and promising 
ones further tested and evaluated. It should be noted that many benefit programs designed to help address energy 
insecurity are not available to people who are not US citizens due to existing state and federal policy.  
Household disconnection prevention: Disconnection protections vary by jurisdiction and circumstance but can 
offer important protections during extreme weather. Most states, including New York State (New York State 
Department of Public Service, 2023), provide some protections from utility disconnections to vulnerable customers 
during dangerously hot or cold weather. In NYC, residential disconnections for non-payment for all residential

Interim Report for Public Release 
30 
customers are suspended just before and after hot days using criteria based on the heat index and on cold days 
using criteria based on wind chill. In Los Angeles, on the other hand, a motion passed in 2022 that prohibits the 
Department of Water and Power from practicing water or power shutoffs as a debt collection tool for income-qualified 
residents and seniors (Smith, 2022). 
Many states also provide time-limited disconnection protection for those with certain medical or other vulnerabilities. 
Some social services agencies provide one-time emergency grants to help people avoid disconnection; the NYC 
Human Resources Administration or HEAP emergency assistance programs are examples (City of New York 
Department of Human Resources Administration, 2023). Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, the New York State Public 
Service Commission prohibited disconnection of residential or small business customers for non-payment. In a May 
2022 testimony of the NYC Policy Panel to the NYS Public Service Commission, city practitioners advocated for 
stronger protections against disconnections, and submitted that customers need greater protections than 
shareholders (Berkman et al., 2022). 
Residential cooling: Ability to afford home air conditioning and energy to run it is the main driver of indoor 
temperature. Air conditioning can lower indoor temperatures and, in some cases, can increase ventilation. Increasing 
home AC access can also reduce health inequities by race and income (Madrigano et al., 2018). In place of AC, split 
heat pumps are another cooling technology that are typically more efficient than a standard AC and also provide 
electric heating (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023). Some types of facilities housing at-risk people are already 
required to maintain safe indoor temperatures during hot weather. For example, federal legislation requires long-term 
care facilities to provide comfortable and safe temperatures, and facilities certified after 1990 are required to keep 
temperatures in a range from 71 to 81°F (National Archives, 2023). Some jurisdictions, such as Dallas, Tucson, and 
Tempe, require that rental properties have cooling equipment (The Times Editorial Board, 2022). 
In addition to increasing AC prevalence for communities without access, NYC has taken measures to reduce the 
need for AC consumption through temperature setpoint policies and cooling strategies. In 2023, NYC announced 
plans to develop maximum indoor temperature policies to protect all residents by 2030 and require cooling in all new 
construction by 2025 (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023; Ostapiuk, 2023). Advocacy groups have also 
proposed a minimum temperature setpoint for larger buildings, such as commercial or office buildings (WE ACT for 
Environmental Justice, 2023a). Energy efficiency measures can help reduce cooling cost burdens, as can cool roofs 
that are painted with white reflective paint to reflect rather than absorb heat, which can reduce indoor temperatures 
(Bock et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021). Green roofs (i.e. roofs covered in vegetation) and other forms of green 
infrastructure that can provide shade and cooling also have benefits to the indoor environment and stormwater 
maintenance but are more expensive to install and maintain.  
Utility subsidies: The federally funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial 
assistance to households that meet income and other criteria to help with energy costs. Examples of health benefits 
from LIHEAP for households include reduced prevalence of undernutrition in young children (Frank et al., 2006). New 
York, like other states, receives a block grant and establishes its own guidelines for distribution within a set of federal 
policies. In complement to LIHEAP, the NYS Public Service Commission can approve subsidies for utility costs. 
During the Covid-19 pandemic, at the request of the city, the NYS Public Service Commission approved a small 
monthly subsidy, roughly $35 per month, to assist 440,000 low-income families in NYC and Westchester with costs of 
operating air conditioners in summer 2020 (City of New York, 2020). Limitations of the current LIHEAP program in 
New York State include not reaching 46% of qualifying households, limited assistance to renters who have heat 
included in their rent, limited funds available for air conditioning purchase, and currently there are no funds for 
summer utility assistance (Office of Community Services, 2022). A New York State extreme heat action plan 
proposed increasing LIHEAP cooling assistance funding and potentially providing summer utility assistance (Hochul 
et al., 2022). National legislation to greatly increase LIHEAP and weatherization funding has been proposed (Ed 
Markey: United States Senator for Massachusetts, 2022). 
Energy efficiency and weatherization assistance: The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and 
Development (HPD) launched its HomeFix program in November 2019, which provided financial assistance and 
individualized support for home repairs. As of the time of this writing the program us not accepting new applicants 
(City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development, 2024). The state-administered 
Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) provides energy efficiency audits and weatherization for qualifying low-
income households. Nationally, in addition to reduced energy use and costs, multiple health benefits have been tied 
to WAP including reductions in asthma morbidity, better prescription adherence, less illness from cold and heat 
stress, reduced fire and CO poisoning risk, less need for food assistance, and increased productivity from improved 
sleep (Tonn et al., 2014). 
Locally, a pilot evaluation of 20 low-income Bronx households receiving energy efficiency upgrade assistance found 
that participants experienced greater thermal comfort and temperature control, reduced energy costs, and less need

Climate Change, Energy, and Energy Insecurity in New York City 
 
Interim Report for Public Release 
31 
for supplemental heating (Hernández & Phillips, 2015). As with LIHEAP, WAP funds are not sufficient to reach most 
qualifying households, and often considered inaccessible and underused particularly by renters. Reaching more 
households and renters may require a community-based and context-dependent approach based on the needs of 
individual communities (Reames, 2016a). Older households with lead, mold, or other contaminants may be denied 
access to weatherization upgrades and there is no current state funding for this type of pre-weatherization 
remediation (New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, 2023; WE ACT for Environmental 
Justice, 2023a). One recommendation that has been offered is that the state create and fund pre-weatherization 
remediation programs (WE ACT for Environmental Justice, 2023a). There is a 'split-incentive barrier' to energy 
efficiency, as those (i.e. landlords) who decide and pay for energy efficiency improvements do not necessarily benefit 
from the investment (Bednar & Reames, 2020; Bird & Hernández, 2012). Given the pervasive, inequitable harms 
from inefficient housing on energy insecurity and health among people of color and low-income households (Jessel et 
al., 2019) – and in particular Black Americans (Lewis et al., 2019) - expanding access to energy efficiency and 
weatherization assistance can contribute to restorative justice.  
Reducing energy prices and debt forgiveness: NYC households have long been burdened by high energy costs. 
In 2016, the New York State utility regulator, the Public Service Commission, set a target energy cost burden for low-
income households at 6 percent. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than half a million NYC residents had 
costs above this threshold, and 460,493 low-income families in NYC are still paying over 6% of their pre-tax income 
toward their energy bills (NYC Mayor’s Office of Sustainability & NYC Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 
2019). The economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, spikes in natural gas prices caused by war in Ukraine, 
and an increase in natural gas use for electricity after the Indian Point nuclear plant closed in 2021 further raised 
energy cost burdens. By March 2022, one in eight residential energy customers in the state were in arrears, the 
majority in NYC and Long Island (New York State Office of the New York State Comptroller, 2022). In response, the 
state and the Public Service Commission announced programs to help customers with these unprecedented levels of 
debt (New York State Office of the New York State Comptroller, 2022). In January 2023, the PSC approved financial 
assistance for past-due utility bills that accrued during the COVID-19 pandemic (New York State, 2023b). Because 
this path forgives the debt through a combination of state tax money and customer subsidization through electric 
rates, it does not result in a long-term reduction of energy prices. Other states have different rate structures, for 
example, using tiered rates based on income. Currently, programs for rate subsidies are only available to individuals 
who pay their energy bills, and not when operators of multifamily buildings pay the bill and roll those energy costs into 
rent. Given recent instability in energy markets due to the volatility in wholesale electricity prices from national and 
global factors (e.g., COVID pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, increased electricity demand during heatwaves 
and winter storms, coal labor shortages that caused increased demand for natural gas), ongoing monitoring and 
evaluation of these programs are needed (New York ISO, 2022; Wholesale U.S. Electricity Prices Were Volatile in 
2022, 2023).  
Community clean energy ownership: The clean energy transition provides opportunities to sustainably reduce 
energy costs while providing more benefits to local communities. Community-owned clean energy typically refers to 
clean energy projects where a community can exercise control over the generation, use, and/or sale of energy 
resources and where the community plays an active role in decision-making. These projects may use different clean 
energy sources, such as wind or solar, at varying scales and capacities (Berka & Creamer, 2018). An example is WE 
ACT for Environmental Justice’s ‘Solar Uptown Now’ campaign that has organized residents of upper Manhattan to 
buy and install solar power in multifamily housing together, sharing the up-front costs and longer-term energy savings 
(WE ACT for Environmental Justice, 2022). These types of projects have been implemented or proposed in other 
geographic contexts, for example, community-owned wind farms across Scotland (Community Energy Scotland, 
2021) and community solar rooftops in Delhi, India (Kumar, 2023). For other examples of community clean energy 
and climate resilience projects in NYC, see NPCC4 Advancing Climate Justice in Climate Adaptation Strategies for 
New York City (Foster et al., 2024, sec. 2.2 and 5.1).  
Resilient and clean energy infrastructure: Reducing secondary impacts due to infrastructure failure will be 
beneficial during multiple hazards, including heat waves, hurricanes, and flooding events. As the transition to low- 
emissions energy supply advances, the need for and development of technology and infrastructure that can improve 
efficiency and reliability, such as battery storage and demand response, is growing. High-efficiency technologies for 
buildings such as ground source heat pumps can also serve to lower peak electric demand (Buonocore et al., 2022). 
Following the passage of Local Law 2 in 2022, the city is evaluating the technical feasibility of district-scale 
geothermal systems (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023a). These clean 
energy technologies have the potential to provide substantial health and equity co-benefits if they are deployed and 
sited using a framework that explicitly prioritizes these goals (Krieger et al., 2016). One potential solution to improve 
efficiency and reliability while increasing the uptake of renewables is to increase energy storage. In addition to large 
utility scale batteries for storage, another need in NYC is for resilient energy backup systems suitable for multi-family 
dwellings, which have a different permitting structure than large-scale outdoor batteries. Such systems are being 
developed to provide electricity during blackouts to common refuge areas for powering life-sustaining equipment,

heating, cooling, lighting, and refrigeration of perishables (Clean Energy Group, 2022; Mango et al., 2021). Such 
systems can use rooftop solar, including community-owned systems that help reduce peak load grid strain and 
energy costs. The city of Toronto, Canada now mandates resilient building energy systems in all new mid- and high-
rise developments (City of Toronto Planning and Development, 2023). In the aftermath of prolonged building-side 
outages following Super Storm Sandy, NYCHA has retrofitted 73 buildings with flood protected backup generators 
(New York City Housing Authority, 2021). Achieving NYC’s targets for reducing GHG emissions by 2050 could avoid 
160 and 390 premature deaths and 460 hospitalizations and emergency department visits for respiratory and 
cardiovascular disease each year, with a societal benefit of $3.4 billion (Johnson et al., 2020).  
7 Opportunities for Future Research 
7.1 
Summary of Knowledge Gaps 
In the context of climate change impacts on vulnerable US populations, the need for more data, research, and 
interventions to address energy insecurity has long been recognized (Hernández, 2013). Below we outline a few 
prominent gaps in research that warrant attention.  
7.1.1 
The need for more household energy use and outage data 
There is an opportunity to enhance our understanding of energy use at the household level if data are available. 
Understanding how households use and do not use energy can help provide vital information to stakeholders. For 
example, Cong et al. (Cong et al., 2022b) used residential electricity consumption data to identify energy use 
behaviors in comparison to income-based measures of energy poverty, uncovering a previously hidden gap in energy 
equity. In addition, timely, spatially granular power outage data is not currently available in NYC. Over the past 9 
years over 50,000 calls for power outages have been collected by the 311-call service, but why these claims have 
been made (why the household experienced a power outage) remains unknown. In addition, relying on 311 calls 
includes shortcomings such as differential reporting based on socio-demographics and the historical exclusion of 
NYCHA residents (Marcotullio, Braçe, et al., 2023). More information on the details of the circumstances would help 
stakeholders to identify outage hotspots, housing and electrical infrastructure or other problems and allow for tracking 
of outages with an equity lens at the community and individual level. Utilities also have data on outages but are not 
required to publicly share historical records of power outage data, which can include the cause of outages and their 
duration.  
7.1.2 
Equity implications of electrification and transition to renewable energy in the context of 
energy insecurity and health 
As the city electrifies and transitions away from fossil fuels and to renewable energy, there are questions about 
whether communities will be able to benefit equitably, and how benefits and burdens will be distributed. There are 
also questions about whether hosting capacity differences will pose challenges across different neighborhoods. Low-
income households in the NYC metropolitan area have a median energy burden of 9.3%, compared to 2.9% city-
wide, and 25% of low-income (≤200% FPL) households have an energy burden greater than 16.8% compared to 
3.4% for non-low-income households (Drehobl et al., 2020). The implications to the energy cost burden of 
transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables and increasing electrification of the building sector are not yet fully 
understood or accounted for. Ensuring equitable access to building electrification and the indoor air quality benefits it 
can provide will require identifying and implementing strategies to address barriers to building electrification, 
particularly in older buildings and NYCHA-owned and affordable housing, such as high upfront or ongoing costs, 
access for renters, cost shifting concerns for tenants, a lack of skilled labor for installations, and upgrades to 
electricity infrastructure and other building modifications for new wiring (Cohn & Wang Esram, 2023; WE ACT for 
Environmental Justice, 2023b). NYCHA has a goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050, 
which will require rehabilitation of its buildings so they can undergo energy retrofits and electrification. The quality of 
NYCHA’s building stock has been challenged by deferred maintenance and underinvestment in public housing 
(Campion, 2023), which complicates the achievement of its GHG reduction goals. In addition to the benefits of 
building electrification to indoor air quality, the transition away from polluting peaker plants to cleaner forms of energy 
can improve outdoor air quality. NYPA commissioned a study in consultation with the PEAK coalition that assessed 
options for replacing NYPA’s existing peaker plants (NYPA, 2022). However, as NYISO attempts to maintain 
reliability standards, they have warned that peaker plants may need to stay on for longer than planned (New York 
Independent System Operator, 2023c). The distribution of benefits and burdens related to exposure to poor outdoor 
air quality and grid reliability challenges will depend on the ability to introduce alternatives like demand response, 
rooftop solar, and battery storage and balance the pace of increasing renewables and efficiency with decreasing 
fossil fuels.

7.1.3 
Transportation 
The expansion of public transit, including Select Bus services in areas such as Eastern Queens holds the potential to 
improve employment, education, shopping, and other opportunities for local communities. By providing efficient and 
reliable transportation options, expanded public transit services can enhance mobility and connectivity, enabling 
easier access to job opportunities, educational institutions, and commercial centers, particularly for individuals who 
may have faced challenges in commuting to distant locations (Heyward & Khalifeh, 2023). Additionally, improved 
access to shopping areas can enhance the availability of goods and services, contributing to economic development 
and community well-being. However, further research is needed to assess the actual impact of the public transit 
expansion on employment rates, educational attainment, local economic growth, and overall community 
development. Addressing this knowledge gap will provide a better understanding of the potential benefits and inform 
decisions regarding public transit expansion to support equitable opportunities and enhance quality of life in these 
communities.

Key Message 1  
While recognizing the urgency to reduce energy use and GHG emissions to meet the City and State’s 
ambitious climate goals and mitigate the impacts of climate change, actions must be approached 
deliberately, considering energy insecurity and health. Challenges, including reducing fossil fuel use, 
acquiring renewables, adapting the grid to meet higher demand, and securing sufficient dispatchable 
generation to ensure reliability during peak periods when solar and wind generation is low can all have 
implications for energy affordability and reliability. While the transition offers opportunities for economic 
growth, improved air quality, and promoting active transport, equitable implementation, and reliable energy 
supply particularly during extreme weather events are important considerations for NYC.  
Description of 
Evidence 
Currently, in NYC there are disparities in environmental burdens such as energy use, costs and electricity 
interruptions between Black and Hispanic and low-income communities and White and high-income 
communities (Drehobl et al., 2020; Marcotullio, Diko, et al., 2023; Ortiz et al., 2022) with significant health 
implications (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2023a; Dominianni, Lane, et al., 
2018). There are also significant differences in opportunities including access to energy-related jobs 
(National Association of State Energy Officials & Clean Energy Initiative, 2021). The Challenges of reducing 
energy-related fossil fuel emissions can further exacerbate these disparities if not addressed adequately. 
Inadequate solutions that exacerbate disparities include reducing grid reliability (NYISO, 2022), placement 
of infrastructure, such as last mile warehouses in low-income and Black and Hispanic communities and 
continued job opportunity exclusion (IREC, 2022; Muro et al., 2019). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Remaining uncertainties include: the pace of the transition and its potential implications for energy 
insecurity; the identification of suitable locations and technologies for renewable energy generation; the 
development of energy storage solutions to address variability in renewable energy production; the precise 
economic and health benefits associated with the transition; the potential challenges related to energy 
equity and how they will be addressed; and strategies for ensuring energy supply reliability during extreme 
weather events. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the evidence base, there is high confidence that New York State will reduce fossil fuel use and 
transition to renewables, although the precise pathway remains unclear. The confidence in the feasibility 
and timeline for achieving the state’s climate goals accordingly is moderate, given the complexities 
involved in transitioning an entire energy system. The confidence in the potential economic and health 
benefits could also be moderate and depends on specific policy decisions and implementation. Confidence 
in equitable implementation and energy supply reliability during extreme weather events may also be 
moderate and require careful planning and policy development.

Key Message 2  
Energy is not only vital for economic growth, but also for human health and well-being – a connection that 
the concept of energy insecurity (EI) highlights. EI can be caused by high energy costs relative to income, 
by frequent energy outages and unreliability, or both. Addressing EI both influences, and is influenced by, 
various domains such as public health, transportation, energy, and housing sectors – all compounded by 
climate change as a threat multiplier.  
 
Description of 
Evidence 
A growing body of literature around the concept of household and community energy insecurity inform its 
consideration as part of a sustainable development strategy, particularly as it relates to human health and 
well-being (Hernández, 2013, 2016a; Jessel et al., 2019). The prevalence and causes of energy insecurity, 
including high energy costs and energy outages, are documented (Energy Information Administration (EIA), 
2017; NYC Mayor’s Office of Sustainability & NYC Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity, 2019; U.S. 
Energy Information Administration, 2020). Information on the measures, policies, and programs that have 
been implemented to address energy insecurity and other energy-related issues nationwide and in New 
York is available (Carley et al., 2021; Murray & Mills, 2014; NYC Mayor’s Office of Sustainability & Mayor’s 
Office for Economic Opportunity, 2019). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Uncertainties remain about New York-specific strategies and initiatives aimed at reducing energy insecurity; 
effectiveness of existing policies and programs in alleviating energy insecurity; and how energy insecurity 
may evolve in response to changes in energy systems and costs. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the strong body of evidence, confidence in the link between energy, human health and well-being is 
very high. Confidence in specific measures and policies to address energy insecurity may vary and 
depend on their effectiveness in practice. Confidence in the interconnections between energy insecurity 
and various sectors may also vary and require further research and analysis. 
Key Message 3 
EI can harm public health directly -- via inadequate heating or cooling, indoor air pollution, and reduced 
ability to reliably use medical devices and refrigeration necessary for health needs -- and indirectly when 
high energy costs reduce spending on other essential items like healthcare and food. Populations most 
vulnerable to EI include those with lower incomes, victims of systemic racism, people with underlying health 
conditions, disabilities, or dependent on electric powered medical equipment, and renters, who are less 
able to access energy subsidies.  
Description of 
Evidence 
There is a large body of evidence that documents the myriad ways in which energy insecurity directly 
impacts health, such as through fires from compromised thermal safety (J. Campbell, 2022; Hernández, 
2022); dangerous coping strategies (Hernández, 2016a; Middlemiss & Gillard, 2015; Simes et al., 2023; 
Yoon & Hernández, 2021) and resulting respiratory issues such as indoor air pollution attributed to the use 
of unsafe heating or cooking methods and exposure to carbon monoxide (Ahrens, 2017; Dennekamp, 
2001; Nicole, 2014; WE ACT for Environmental Justice, 2023b); interruption in life-supporting electrical-
powered medical equipment (Casey et al., 2021; Mango et al., 2021). Research also documents indirect 
impacts of energy insecurity on health, such as compromised spending on other life essentials such as 
medication (Harker Steele & Bergstrom, 2021; Memmott et al., 2021; Simes et al., 2023); food-borne 
illnesses from lack of refrigeration (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022c; 
Gotanda et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2021); and foregoing other essential daily needs (Bansah et al., 2011; 
Hager et al., 2010). Statistics show that New Yorkers who are racialized and low-income (Frank et al., 
2006; Murray & Mills, 2014; Reames, 2016b), rely on electric-powered medical equipment (Casey et al., 
2021; Yoon & Hernández, 2021), living with existing medical conditions (Hernández, 2018; Simes et al., 
2023), and renters (Bird & Hernández, 2012; RentHop, 2023) are disproportionately impacted by energy 
insecurity.  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Energy insecurity remains a complex and evolving issue with several key uncertainties. Measuring energy 
insecurity lacks a universal standard, making comparisons challenging. Data availability and quality vary, 
hindering precise assessment. Long-term health impacts and interactions with other determinants of health 
need further exploration. Assessing the effectiveness of interventions and policies is also an ongoing 
challenge. Advancements in energy technology and their impact on access and health outcomes require 
further monitoring, as does the long-term effect of policies.  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, there is very high confidence that without significant 
and equity-oriented policies targeted at reducing energy insecurity, the direct and indirect consequences for 
New Yorkers’ health will continue to be exacerbated.

Key Message 4 
Climate resilience investments in energy infrastructure and mitigation plans for the transition from fossil 
fuels to renewable energy and the electrification of buildings and transportation could impact future energy 
reliability and costs. Vulnerable populations are most at risk from any potential increases in power outage 
risks or energy costs, which may be exacerbated by projected climate extremes in NYC, such as extreme 
heat, cold, and flooding. Equitable and just policies and investments in the energy and housing sectors can 
reduce future health risks from EI and shape a more resilient and equitable future.  
Description of 
Evidence 
NPCC4, Balk et al(Balk et al., 2024) provides evidence on the challenges and opportunities of transitioning 
from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. There is an existing evidence base for potential impacts of 
climate resilience investments for future energy reliability and costs particularly on the potential impacts of 
electrification of the building and transportation sectors on the energy system (New York Independent 
System Operator, 2023c). These new investments and plans’ potential disproportionate impact on 
vulnerable populations is supported by studies that have evaluated existing disparities of the energy system 
(Drehobl et al., 2020; Lane et al., 2022; Lyubich, 2020; Marcotullio, Diko, et al., 2023; Ortiz et al., 2022) The 
support for equitable policies and investments in the energy and housing sectors towards reducing future 
health risks from energy insecurity can be found in Lewis et al, Kreiger et al, and Jessel et al (Jessel et al., 
2019; Krieger et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2019). In particularly on, data on the potential impacts of 
electrification of the building heating and transportation sectors on the energy system are derived from 
NYISO (New York Independent System Operator, 2023c).  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
The effectiveness of climate resilience investments in mitigating energy infrastructure risks is an evolving 
field, and strategies and innovations in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables continue to emerge. 
Uncertainties remain regarding the exact impacts of electrification on energy reliability and costs.  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is very high confidence in this finding based on 1) well-documented support for the close links 
between EI, human health, and well-being, and 2) strong evidence about the disproportionate impacts of EI 
on marginalized populations. Confidence in the specific impacts of electrification on energy reliability and 
costs may vary and depend on local factors and technologies. 
 
9 Sustained Assessment 
A sustained assessment of energy and energy insecurity in New York stands as a critical endeavor for both the 
present and the future. As the state strives to reduce its carbon footprint and transition toward renewable energy 
sources, an ongoing evaluation of energy systems and their resilience is imperative. This comprehensive assessment 
should not only encompass the reliability and costs of energy but also acknowledge the profound interplay between 
energy access, resource and economic sustainability, and human health and well-being. In a landscape where 
vulnerable populations are most susceptible to energy-related challenges, the pursuit of equitable and just policies 
and investments in the energy sector becomes paramount. Table 3 includes indicators and key metrics to track 
progress on impact, vulnerability, resilience, and interventions towards climate-friendly energy futures without 
compromising household or community energy security.  
This sustained inquiry into New York's energy dynamics promises to shape a more resilient, equitable, and 
sustainable future for all its residents. These indicators should be considered alongside those from NPCC4 (Foster et 
al., 2024; Matte et al., 2024), recognizing that energy security and the health and well-being of all New Yorkers are 
intrinsically linked.

Climate Change, Energy, and Energy Insecurity in New York City
Annex A: Energy Insecurity - Global, 
National, and Historical Context
Energy or fuel poverty are terms that have been used internationally to 
describe a lack of access or means to afford modern energy services 
and products needed for health and development.  In developing 
countries, a lack of clean household energy for cooking and heating1 is 
a major cause of preventable illness and death. While energy access is 
improving in many developing economies, by one estimate 733 million 
people without access to reliable electricity and 2.4 billion people using 
dangerous and inefficient cooking systems.2 Among this population, 
those that lack access to energy include those that simply cannot 
afford it. Access to electricity in the US is virtually universal, while in 
Malawi, for example, only about 11% of the population has electricity 
access3 and more than 95% of people depend on solid household fuels.  
Globally, household air pollution from use of solid fuels for cooking 
and other needs caused an estimated 2.3 million deaths in 2019, 
from causes including childhood pneumonia, COPD, heart disease 
and strokes, diabetes, low birth weight and preterm birth.4,5 Improving 
clean household energy access is a UN sustainable development goal 
(number 7).  
A lack of energy access and excessive cost burden also exists in 
developed economies.6 “Fuel poverty” was first studied intensively in 
the United Kingdom.7 As with energy insecurity, fuel poverty considers 
all essential energy services (not just heating), what is needed (not only 
what is used), and housing energy inefficiency as a major cause. 
In the United States, electricity came first to cities more than 100 
years ago, and the need to expand access was recognized. The rural 
electrification program beginning in the 1930s improved electricity 
access in rural areas from less than 10% to near-universal. Among 
other benefits, a decline in infant mortality has been attributed to this 
program.8 With modern energy connections becoming near universal 
in the US, excessive energy cost burden emerged as a major hardship 
for both urban and rural households. This concept has been the focus 
of many U.S. researchers who study the relative costs of energy to 
households. The energy burden focuses on the household energy bill as 
a percentage of the household’s annual income.
For New York State, the energy burden is defined as households that 
spend more than 6% of their annual income on energy.9,10 According 
to the US DOE's Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool 
the national average energy burden for low-income households is 
8.6%, three times higher than for non-low-income households which is 
estimated at 3%. In some areas, depending on location and income, 
the energy burden can be as high as 30%.11 Nevertheless, the extent of 
the energy household burden has been a persistent if underappreciated 
problem in the United States.12 For example, urban and rural low- 
income households (defined as 80% of area median income or 150% 
federal poverty level) spend roughly three times as much of their 
income on energy cost as compared to non-low-income households 
(7.2% and 9% versus 2.3% and 3.1%, respectively.13,14 Moreover, low-
income, African American, Latinx, multifamily and renter households 
are disproportionately impacted by high energy burdens.13 Out of a total 
of 118.2 million US households, in 2015, the US Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) estimated that 17 million households received an 
energy disconnect/delivery stop notice and 25 million households had to 
forgo food and medicine to pay energy bills.15
The results of the energy burden have been identified as energy 
insecurity, or the state in which households cannot meet their energy 
needs.16 This term refers to the uncertainty that a household faces 
in being able to make utility bill payments.17 The point emphasized 
from this concept is that the stress from insecurity creates significant 
health issues.18 For example, the results of energy insecurity include 
extreme home temperatures, hazardous heating alternatives, and the 
constant threat of utility shut-offs or mounting arrears in utility bills 
because of nonpayment. This problem is especially acute for low-income 
residents such as single parents, the elderly, the disabled, and others 
with low or fixed incomes.19,20 Those facing energy insecurity may be 
homeowners unable to invest in efficiency upgrades or may be renters 
living in housing units where landlords do not pay for the utilities and 
consequently have very little incentive to create more energy efficient 
units.21 Energy insecurity is an important issue in the US. The DOE 
EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) data for 2015 
suggest that 31% of U.S. households experienced some form of energy 
insecurity. That year, nearly seven million households had their access 
to heat interrupted at least once, and six million lost access to air 
conditioning at least once.22 Adequate housing and income are central 
to energy justice. Energy justice is a branch of environmental justice23,24 
focused on the notion that all individuals should have access to energy 
that is affordable, safe, sustainable and able to sustain a decent lifestyle, 
as well as the opportunity to participate in and lead energy decision-
making processes with the authority to make change.25–27 Energy justice 
scholarship stresses that neither the adaptation to climate change nor 
the renewable energy transition is inherently just nor democratizing in 
terms of the distribution of technologies and benefits.28 Energy justice 
is based upon disparities within energy systems closely associated with 
housing including, inter alia, notions concerning energy poverty, fuel 
poverty, energy burden and energy insecurity.

Annex B: 311 Calls for Summer Power 
Outages - Methods
Researchers tested whether the 311 calls were clustered, dispersed or 
randomly distributed throughout the city.29 Using spatial statistical test, 
the research found that there is a clustering of high numbers of 311-calls 
made between 2013 and 2022. That is, high numbers of calls were 
spatially clustered together as were low numbers of calls. A specific test, 
called the Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) demonstrated 
the location of these different levels of calls. The results of this analysis 
are presented in Annex Figure B-1 (left panel). Across most of the 
census tracts in the city, there is no clustering of calls amounts, but 
high numbers of calls are clustered in Northern Manhattan, parts of the 
Bronx, central Brooklyn, and Southeastern Queens. Areas designated as 
High-High (HH) signal locations of high absolute numbers of 311-calls for 
power outages (i.e., above the mean level of 311-calls for power outages 
per census tract) and where the adjacent census tracts also had High 
absolute number of 311-calls for power outages. The HH designation 
indicates areas of spatially clustered high levels of 311-calls for loss of 
power. Alternatively, areas designated as Low-Low (LL) are areas of low 
absolute numbers of 311-calls for power outages (i.e., below the citywide 
Annex Figure B 1. Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) results for 311 calls for power outages by census tract 
from January 1, 2014-January 1, 2023 (left). The distribution of percent population in poverty by quantile and census tract in 
New York City 2020 (right)
mean for 311-calls for power outages per census tract) and the adjacent 
cells are also areas of low absolute numbers of 311-calls for power 
outages.
Selected socio-economic characteristics of the census tracts with 
different levels of 311 calls were also examined. The research identified 
that there is an association between the levels of calls and the level of 
poverty within the different clusters. The distribution of those in poverty 
is presented in Annex Figure B-1 (right panel). A statistical test (student’s 
t-test) of the means of the percent poverty in census tracts in high call 
cluster areas and the percent of poverty in census tract of low call cluster 
areas is significant (t = 3.5806, df = 84.929, p-value = 0.0006).  
The results suggest that there is a significantly higher percentage of the 
population in poverty within census tracts with high numbers of calls 
compared to the percentage of population in poverty in census tracts 
with low numbers of calls. The mean percent in poverty in census tracts 
with high cluster calls is 26.0% and the mean percent of poverty in the 
census tracts with low cluster calls is 19.3%.

Annex C: Energy Transition Plans, Reliability, 
and Affordability - Challenges for NYC
As NYC addresses consistency with the Climate Leadership and 
Community Protection Act (CLCPA) and the commitment to carbon 
neutrality, there will be a growing need for technology and infrastructure 
that can improve efficiency and reliability. Over the course of the next 
few decades, New York State has committed to an energy transition. The 
transition is slated to occur through a decrease in use of fossil fuels to 
generate electrical power, while electrifying transportation and building 
energy services including heating, hot water, and cooking. Plans call 
for replacing fossil fuels with renewables including solar, wind, and 
hydropower.30 The role of nuclear power remains an open question. 
NYC will play a significant role in the energy transition, as the city’s 
energy use is a major share of state energy use (30%) and the city 
produces 40% of the state’s GHG emissions. The City also has 
committed to carbon neutrality by 2050.31 At the same time, the City 
faces significant challenges in reducing the use of fossil fuels, acquiring 
renewables and electrifying sectors. The City’s commitment to carbon 
neutrality is envisioned through the use of increased renewable energy 
generation, battery storage, and renewable energy transmission from 
up-State and beyond. All transportation and building energy demand 
are slated to be met by renewable electricity, meaning that electricity 
demand will increase dramatically. In order to meet low carbon fuel goals 
and reduce emissions, the City plans three important strategies:
1.	
Transform the electricity system to deliver 100% zero-emission 
electricity to buildings and the capacity to provide the same for 
more than a million zero emission vehicles (ZEVs);
2.	
Transform the current natural gas system to deliver low carbon gas 
(e.g., such as hydrogen or renewable natural gas) for end uses too 
costly and complex to fully electrify; and
3.	
Provide low carbon steam system for heating and cooling to some 
of the largest and most difficult buildings to decarbonize.32 
According to New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), given 
current trends and conditions, annual baseline energy use will increase 
from 49,230 GWh in 2023 to 68,810 GWh in 2050 (40% increase) 
and baseline peak demand is projected to increase from 11,023 MW 
to 13,200 MW over the same period.33 Energy storage to allow for 
renewable energy use is currently 22 MW and is projected to increase 
to 704 MW by 2050, and this storage will increase energy provision from 
3 GWh in 2023 to 686 GWh in 205033 (about 10% of annual electricity 
demand during that 2050 period). Two transmission lines will deliver 
renewable energy to NYC; the Champlain-Hudson Power Express 
(CHPE) project that will deliver hydropower from Canada directly to 
Queens, and the New York Power Authority (NYPA)-led proposal, known 
as Clean Path NY, which proposes to deliver renewable energy from 
upstate New York directly to NYC.  
There are at least four concerns to meeting carbon neutrality given 
current plans. The first is that many of the technologies to meet carbon 
neutrality goals are not yet commercially available. As a NYC study 
states, additional innovation is needed as battery storage technology is 
untested and undeveloped at the scale required to decarbonize NYC.32 
For example, Fekete et al.34 points out that current battery storage 
technologies have limited capacity that may not meet the need for base 
load given seasonal variation in renewable energy generation. Current 
research suggests that studies of net-zero decarbonization include 
carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).35 In fact, many studies suggest 
that CO2 emission reductions of great than 50% will not be possible 
without CCS.36 CSS was not considered in the City’s plans, suggesting 
contrary to research that the City’s transition could indeed reduce 
carbon emissions without it. New York State is currently in the process 
of defining what constitutes ‘zero emissions’ that meet CLCPA targets,37 
to which there have been environmental, equity and justice-related 
concerns about the implications of fuels and technologies that may be 
included (e.g., nuclear, biofuels, hydrogen).38
Second, there are reliability concerns with the transition to a larger 
role of the electricity grid. Recently, the New York Independent System 
Operator (NYISO) finds that thinning reliability margins over the next 
decade present increased challenges to reliability for NYC.39 NYISO 
quarterly assessment of reliability of the bulk electric system found a 
deficit in reliability margins for the NYC area beginning in summer 2025. 
The deficit is as large as 446 MW, driven primarily by the combination of 
a forecasted increase in peak demand (through the electrification of the 
transportation and building sectors, continued economic growth following 
the pandemic) and the unavailability of certain generators (Peaker 
plants).
Third, the electricity costs and affordability are important concerns. New 
York State is among the top 10 states with the highest electricity costs in 
the country. In 2023, cost of residential electricity was 21.92 cents/KWh 
compared to 15.92 cents/KWh for the country.40 Costs will be increasing, 
as in June 2023, Con Ed requested another increase in electricity 
rates resulting in a roughly 12% increase for customers over the next 
three years.41 These increases will go towards financing upgrades to 
the company's electricity delivery system, funding renewable energy 
plans and improving overall infrastructure. Continual rate increases can 
be critical for some NYC residents as approximately 610,000 families 
(representing 18% of total families in the city) pay greater than 6 percent 
of their household income and are therefore considered energy cost 
burdened.9 Moreover, as there are large areas in the city that have low 
hosting capacity there will be a need to further upgrade the electricity 
grid in these locations so as to provide equitable renewable energy 
access.
Finally, there is concern whether Con Edison will be able to provide 
enough electricity distribution necessary to meet the increased demand 
for heating and transportation during the transition and if this increase 
can be accomplished while keeping affordability in check.

NYSERDA currently has 
five offshore wind projects in 
active development, totaling 
more than 4,300 megawatts – 
nearly half of the State’s goal 
for 9,000 megawatts by 2030. 
In July 2022, NYSERDA 
launched a third offshore 
wind solicitation to procure 
at least 2,000 additional 
megawatts of offshore wind 
energy for New Yorkers.
In addition to greening 
the grid, the offshore wind 
industry can bring thousands 
of new jobs to NYC and 
help revitalize our working 
waterfronts–like the efforts 
currently underway to 
transform the South Brooklyn 
Marine Terminal into an 
offshore wind staging site.
New York has entered into 
agreements to provide new 
jobs to EJ communities. 
The New York City Public 
Design Commission (PDC) 
has approved Equinor's 
design for the offshore wind 
operations and maintenance 
building to be constructed 
at the South Brooklyn

The approval from the PDC 
allows for advancement 
of New York's first-ever, 
purpose-built offshore wind

Abstract: 
This chapter of the New York City Panel on Climate Change 4 (NPCC4) report discusses the many intersecting 
social, ecological, and technological-infrastructure dimensions of New York City and their interactions that are critical 
to address in order to transition to and secure a climate-adapted future for all New Yorkers. The authors provide an 
assessment of current approaches to “future visioning and scenarios” across community and city level initiatives and 
examine diverse dimensions of the NYC urban system to reduce risk and vulnerability and enable a future adapted 
NYC. Methods for the integration of community and stakeholder ideas about what would make NYC thrive with 
scientific and technical information on the possibilities presented by different policies and actions is discussed. This 
chapter synthesizes the state of knowledge on how different communities of scholarship or practice envision futures 
and provides brief descriptions of the social-demographic and housing, transportation, energy, nature-based, and 
health futures and many other subsystems of the complex system of NYC that will all interact to determine NYC 
futures.

1 Chapter Summary 
This chapter provides the first of its kind of assessment for New York City (NYC) of positive future visions, scenarios, 
and their intersections with current challenges, which can inform new modes and models for equitable climate change 
policy, planning, and engagement across the diverse social and infrastructural fabric of the city. Here we consider 
additional aspects of NYC’s built, social, and natural infrastructure that were not fully considered in NPCC3 (New 
York City Panel on Climate Change, 2019) but have become especially salient in the time since. We discuss the 
many intersecting social, ecological, and technological-infrastructure dimensions of the city and their interactions that 
must be simultaneously considered to transition to and secure a climate-adapted future for all New Yorkers. We 
assess current approaches to futures research, visioning, and scenarios across community and city-level initiatives 
and discuss multiple dimensions of the NYC urban system to reduce risk and vulnerability and to enable an NYC that 
is adapted to future climate change. In doing so, we synthesize the state of knowledge on social-demographic, 
economic, transportation, housing, health futures, and many other subsystems of the complex system of NYC that 
will all interact to determine NYC futures. 
1.1 
Key Messages 
Key Message 1: NYC is projected to be hotter, wetter, and more flood prone, with multiple 
types of tropical and winter storms that are likely to increase in frequency, intensity, and 
severity. At the same time, the population of the city is expected to age. Long traditions of in- 
and out-migration have shaped the city and are expected to continue to be an important part of 
its future, anchoring it in the region and the nation. The built environment will largely remain in 
place, yet changes in land use and land cover, including conversions in impervious and natural 
areas, are expected. Managing and planning the future NYC to be more adapted and resilient 
to diverse climate, economic, and social pressures will require understanding these diverse 
futures that also interact dynamically in real-time. 
Key Message 2: Future complexity and uncertainty due to climate change demands new ways 
to plan our cities. Scenario-based planning can incorporate important urban dynamics and 
complexities and uncertainties common to the non-anecdotal challenges of the Anthropocene 
that other planning tools cannot, partly by addressing uncertainty over the mid-to-long term. By 
incorporating scenario planning into NYC futuring exercises, a range of new opportunities for 
envisioning and shaping health, social, environmental, economic, and population change 
outcomes can be applied to meet broad or sectoral adaptation and mitigation planning. 
Key Message 3: Equity and social justice should be explicitly centered in future climate 
adaptation goals, implementation efforts, and future planning. Planning without centering equity 
will likely result in unintended negative consequences, such as green gentrification or 
displacement, which exacerbate inequity. Centering equity in climate adaptation and mitigation 
actions provides an opportunity to decrease impacts on the most vulnerable.  
Key Message 4: NYC is dynamic, and the scale and complexity of NYC requires managing 
interacting socio-economic, ecological-biophysical, and technological-infrastructure 
components. However, there is often a lack of understanding by planners of the fundamental 
drivers of behaviors and patterns that are important for planning and designing more resilient, 
equitable, and adapted NYC and metropolitan region. Inherent in these interdependencies are 
trade-offs between temporal and spatial scales in planning activities, as well as between 
sectors; identifying these trade-offs is integral to transparency in planning and adaptation. 
Incorporating approaches that acknowledge interdependencies in future planning will prevent a 
siloed understanding of trade-offs and uncertainties.  
Key Message 5: In the context of climate change risks in NYC and the metropolitan region, 
changes in key sectors and deployment of technologies have included some which are adaptive 
and beneficial and others that are unintentionally maladaptive, causing risks and inequities that 
are costly to reverse. The adaptive or maladaptive potential of such changes have depended on 
the extent to which their costs, benefits, and risks are balanced and equitably distributed. Local 
examples considered in this chapter include mechanical cooling, flood protection measures,

and spatial allocation of the public right of way (ROW, mainly streets and sidewalks). 
Maladaptation can be caused by ignoring climate risks and equity considerations and by siloed 
planning, within and among sectors, levels of government, government agencies, non-
governmental institutions, and the private sector. Potential for maladaptive and inequitable 
effects of climate adaptation strategies and other sectoral actions influencing climate risks 
should be weighed to ensure that near-term actions are not maladaptive in the long term.   
Key Message 6: Without shared positive visions for the future, it is unlikely that plans made 
now will achieve the equity, justice, sustainability, and resilience goals desired for the future of 
NYC and its communities. Participatory processes are critical in co-developing shared visions 
that bring together diverse perspectives and forms of knowledge, and a sustained engagement 
process is critically needed to identify the City’s climate research priorities and co-produce a 
future public climate research agenda for the city. Co-produced visions, goals, and strategies 
can involve perspectives across multiple sectors, scales, and communities to gather the full 
range of ideas, innovations, and possible actions to address trade-offs and inform transitions 
toward a climate-adapted future for NYC. However, tools for longer-term (beyond 2050) 
transitions and pathways to achieve future plans for NYC are currently missing and needed to 
guide efforts to secure an inclusive climate resilient future for all New Yorkers. In order to track 
progress towards these goals, periodic and systematic monitoring and evaluation are 
necessary.  
Key Message 7: Transitioning the built environment to be more climate resilient while 
addressing fundamental challenges to equity and sustainability requires policies and 
investments to retrofit, rebuild, and improve the built infrastructure to support population health. 
Prioritizing active and sustainable modes, including transit, walking, and cycling can provide 
multiple, equitable health benefits through increased physical activity, reduced air pollution 
exposure, more affordable transportation options, and reduced risk of conditions that increase 
vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, reducing miles driven by private motor 
vehicles within, into, and out of the city will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
expand space available on streets and sidewalks for uses that provide climate resilience and 
social and equity benefits. 
Key Message 8: Nature-based solutions are critical for addressing climate adaptation needs in 
the city and can simultaneously provide co-benefits for public health, society, and natural 
systems that help create a resilient city. Planning, implementation, and management of nature-
based solutions to achieve equitable distribution and holistic resilience in a complex city system 
is still a developing practice. 
2 Introduction 
 
2.1 
Chapter Scope and Context 
Prior NPCC reports and other scientific assessment bodies have established that the future climate of New York will 
very likely be hotter, more flood-prone, and battered by a range of climate induced weather hazards from cold snaps, 
drought conditions, extreme rainfall, coastal storms, heat waves and potential for overlapping weather extremes 
(Braneon et al., 2024; González et al., 2019; Gornitz et al., 2019; Orton et al., 2019). Loss of life and damages from 
these and other climatic hazards are occurring across the globe and the United States, and billions are being spent 
annually to recover from or moderate future damages. In the US, from 1980 to 2005, the total normalized (inflation 
adjusted) losses for the 66 major weather events total over $500 billion. Fifty-seven of these disasters occurred 
during the 1988- 2005 period with total unadjusted damages/costs of over $370 billion (Lott & Ross, 2006). From 
1988 to 2017, increased precipitation costs alone were estimated to contribute about one-third (36%) of the cost of 
flood damages in the country with a cumulative total of approximately $73 billion (Davenport et al., 2021). These 
recent events suggest that adaptation will be critical to advance with as much political will and financial investment as 
mitigation efforts in NYC and the broader region. However, in addition to projected climate hazards – including 
potential exposure of vulnerable populations, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems – there are myriad socio-
demographic, economic, infrastructure, and ecological futures that will unfold in the complex urban system of NYC 
that in turn will impact the city’s future risk and resilience to climate change. While there is high confidence in the

broad outlines of future climate threats and their impacts, there is a need to develop plans for the future that are 
robust to uncertainty in the details of exactly when and how in the city’s complex human geography these damages 
will occur.  
In this chapter, we discuss the many intersecting social, ecological, and technological-infrastructure dimensions of the 
city and their interactions that are critical to address in order to transition to and secure a climate-adapted future for 
all New Yorkers. Here we provide an assessment of current approaches to “future visioning and scenarios” across 
community and city level initiatives and examine diverse dimensions of the NYC urban system to reduce risk and 
vulnerability and enable a future adapted NYC. We review methods for integrating community and stakeholder ideas 
about what would make NYC thrive with scientific and technical information on the possibilities presented by different 
policies and actions. In doing so, we synthesize the state of knowledge on how different communities of scholarship 
or practice envision futures and provide brief descriptions of the social-demographic and housing, transportation, 
energy, nature-based, and health futures and many other subsystems of the complex system of NYC that will all 
interact to determine NYC futures. For further consideration of energy and energy insecurity, and related issues in the 
transportation and building sectors, in the context of NYC’s future, see NPCC4, Yoon et al., (2024). This chapter is a 
novel contribution to planning the city of the future through the new NPCC Futures and Transitions Working Group. 
The NPCC3 inventoried multiple NYC critical infrastructure domains and infrastructure resilience strategies to 
address climate risks (New York City Panel on Climate Change, 2019). Here we consider additional aspects of NYC’s 
built, social, and natural infrastructure that were not fully considered in NPCC3 but have become especially salient. 
We provide the first of its kind of assessment for NYC of positive future visions, scenarios, and their intersections with 
current city challenges that can inform new modes and models for climate change policy, planning, and engagement 
across the diverse social and infrastructural fabric of the city. We hope the chapter contributes to assessing 
alternative visions, scenarios, imaginaries, and possibilities for a climate adapted, sustainable, and equitable future 
NYC. 
2.2 
Chapter Organization 
In this chapter, we examine the state of knowledge on alternative futures and scenarios across sectors and 
approaches for NYC and assess how current planning and policy can take advantage of multiple tools for 
transformative climate action to achieve a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future for the city.  
NYC can only be resilient if it articulates inclusive visions, goals, targets, and clear strategies for ensuring an 
equitable city as well as the means to evaluate progress made towards these goals, strategies and implementation 
efforts (Blake et al., 2019; Jacob et al., 2010; Solecki et al., 2015; Solecki & Rosenzweig, 2020). Inclusiveness in 
resilience also requires that justice and equity be centered in all actions designed to address the growing climate 
challenge in the city (Foster et al., 2019).Thus, there is a clear need for many tools, and a plurality of perspectives, 
both to envision the future of NYC that is more resilient, equitable, and sustainable, but also to backcast from those 
visions to interrogate how current planning, policy, and actions at multiple scales are, or are not, creating the 
mechanisms for transforming and transitioning the city along trajectories that will lead us to the normative futures we 
aspire to. 
The city already employs a wide range of practices to plan for its future and enable transitions for a climate adapted 
NYC. The concept of transition is a powerful tool with which to understand the dynamics of system change during 
development. Transitions can be defined as breaks in long-term trends and include both the quantities and rates of 
change in quantities of interest (National Research Council, 1999). Transitions may occur in any sector (such as 
energy) or process (such as population change). The community of climate and climate-related research offers 
additional concepts and tools for predicting the future. These concepts and tools differ largely by discipline with 
implications for how concepts and tools are used across temporal, spatial, and thematic scale, as well as 
opportunities for engagement. Yet, scholars have been increasingly interested in the concept of transitions as a way 
to manage change. There is a growing consensus that continuing to operate in a business-as-usual manner is 
insufficient for keeping humanity within a ‘safe operating space’ (Rockström et al., 2009).  
In the sections that follow, we review some of the main concepts and tools and what they already tell us about the 
likely trajectory of the social fabric and climate of NYC. Much of the content of this chapter details methodologies that 
may be technical for some readers; our goal was not to alienate a broad audience but rather to be as transparent as 
possible to help move collectively into an interdisciplinary space. Though the focus of this chapter is largely on 
climate adaptation and resilience, climate mitigation goals and actions are discussed in context of how they can be 
addressed alongside adaptation strategies.

3 Concepts and Tools for Exploring the Future 
This section outlines a number of useful planning approaches, beginning with an overview of the City’s major 
planning exercises to place current efforts in context. Throughout this chapter, we refer to short-term as pertaining to 
the next decade, medium-term as referring to a period out 30-50 years (and frequently mid-century is used as a 
reference point) and long-term as referring to the future 80-100 years out, roughly at the end the 21st century. As the 
NPCC’s end-of-century climate projections make evident, there is a commensurate need for long-term scenario 
planning in order to be resilient to climate challenges anticipated in coming decades, until the end of the century, and 
beyond. 
3.1 
Historical Context for New York City Comprehensive and Strategic Planning 
Futures planning for NYC has a long history dating back to, at least, 1811, when the commissioners of the City 
developed the NYC grid to expedite the future of parcel sales and city growth (Jackson et al., 2010). Subsequent 
planning efforts included a number of important, but ad hoc efforts, such as the financing of the Erie Canal and the 
development of the city’s water supply system (Jackson, 1993). The modern city planning era began with the City’s 
1916 Zoning Resolution. 
It was the completion of the 42-story Equitable Building in Manhattan, NYC, in 1915, which set the stage for the 
nation’s first comprehensive citywide zoning resolution. The law governing land use was a response to the perceived 
lack of sun and air and had enormous future impact on the development of the city as it established height and 
setback controls and designated residential districts that excluded other incompatible uses. The 1916 Zoning 
Resolution was amended frequently with major shifts in population and land use.  
Eventually, powerful business associations, newspapers, real estate groups and influential residents pressed for an 
agency to administer the zoning regulations in a systematic fashion. Under Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, in 1936, the 
New York City Planning Commission was established, headed by Adolph A. Berle, who was shortly replaced by 
Rexford Tugwell, and included other notable New Yorkers such as Lawrence Orton, Cleveland Rodgers and Arthur V. 
Sheridan (City of New York Department of City Planning, 1989).  
The City Planning Commission provided the structure for the professional application of comprehensive planning 
principles that replaced the previous haphazard development and zoning decisions driven by politically connected 
interest groups. The new Department of City Planning, headed by the City Planning Commission, was mandated to 
develop scientific processes that helped to identify the goals and aspirations for community development. The idea of 
comprehensive planning emerged in the 1920s and was embraced by Rexford Tugwell, previously a member of 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s “Brain Trust” and head of the Resettlement Administration from 1935 to 1937 (Alvey, 
2019). Comprehensive planning was based upon the notion that long term goals for a broad array of urban services 
important for the common good could be developed through consensus (Soomro & Williams, 2021). The 
comprehensive plan was promoted as the anecdote to “spot zoning”.  
Despite the promise of a scientific comprehensive plan for the city, however, efforts were met with fierce opposition 
(Nelson, 2018). For example, Tugwell’s idea of a strong government that could deliver a unified vision for the city’s 
growth, was harshly criticized by Robert Moses. Moses rejected the concept of government-sponsored master 
planning and preferred to pursue projects based upon available funding, the needs of private developers and his own 
political agenda (Chronopoulos, 2012). He successfully stopped early comprehensive efforts by the City Planning 
Commission for the next several decades (Alvey, 2019). 
NYC underwent dramatic changes, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. The Lindsay administration, in an 
attempt to address increasing poverty, white flight, urban renewal failures, and racial inequality, attempted the first 
comprehensive plan for the city, published in 1969 entitled, “Plan for New York City: A Proposal” (New York City 
Planning Commission, 1969). The focus of the plan was on employment opportunities, housing needs and community 
improvement, and community participation in development decisions. The plan also attempted to respond to critiques 
of comprehensive planning as representative of unrealistic and top-down approaches; rationalism involving the 
search for the ‘optimal’ strategies that either do not exist or are too difficult to implement (Boyer, 1986; Van der 
Heijden, 1996). What was different about this plan was that the Lindsay administration divided the city into 62 
community districts (now 59) and subsequently held 62 separate public hearings on the plan itself. These meetings 
were intended to galvanize public support. Each community district was provided detailed information on the then-
current trends within their regions, including, inter alia, the number of schools, quality of transportation and local 
development. The plan recommended municipal expenditures of $52 billion at the time (when the total city 
expenditures were around $8 billion), for projects that would last into the 1970s (Stein, 1976; Tolchin, 1971).

The attempt to garner community support ultimately failed as the plan drew criticism as a top-down approach that 
presented results to communities as a fait accompli with limited ability for local feedback (Gupte, 1973). Also, urban 
advocates, such as Jane Jacobs, were developing notions of the human, smaller scale, approaches to planning and 
along with anti-statists rejected “Big Planning” notions that were emblematic to comprehensive planning (Klemek, 
2007, 2009). Indeed, the plan was never implemented. 
The debate in NYC mirrored the national discussion over urban planning. Some advocated for comprehensive 
planning while others called for incremental methods (Lindblom, 1959). Incrementalists advocated for planning 
without radical change but rather for making land use decisions that could be implemented (Slusser, 2007). This often 
translated into planning for small areas or even individual parcels. When John Zuccotti headed the City Planning 
Commission in 1973, the notion of comprehensive planning was put aside. Zuccotti, sided with real estate and other 
non-statists to advocate for incremental methods. In 1975, the City Charter was amended, and the comprehensive 
plan requirement was repealed. Subsequently, the planning provision in the Charter was replaced by a provision for 
plans for the development, growth, and improvement of the city and of its boroughs and community districts, giving 
communities a larger voice in land use decisions (see the New York City Charter, Chapter 8, Section 197a (City of 
New York, 2023b)). This new mandate helped to stimulate community planning efforts. At the same time, the new 
charter made provisions for the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) (Eldredge, 2015). ULURP, and later, 
the Environmental Impact Assessment review, both of which reviewed individual development proposals, became the 
major tools to assess and regulate the city’s land use for the next several decades. The thinking behind these 
procedures was to allow the affected communities the opportunity to stop a development or find common ground and 
come to a compromise with the developer. The 197a and ULURP provisions were the compromise that continued 
efforts to control development but prevent Robert Moses-like large infrastructure projects (Eldredge, 2015). The result 
of these rules was to make comprehensive planning for the city difficult if not impossible. 
During the following decades, NYC underwent further dramatic transformations as its economic base shifted to 
business and professional services, which along with an international attractiveness and strong national political and 
cultural status, drove its growth to new heights. It was one of the first identified global cities (Sassen, 1991). During 
this period, NYC experienced a rebirth as crime dropped and population increased. Planners responded during this 
era with new future planning approaches, including strategic planning. Strategic planning is a flexible on-going 
process that attempts to identify major goals, mandates, and challenges for the future. It is a deliberative and iterative 
process that helps organizations address what they do and why (Bryson et al., 2018). Typically, strategic plans are 
for the near term (3-10 years), are not as all-encompassing as comprehensive plans and are not mandated by 
statute. At the same time, strategic plans help decision-makers allocate resources to attain goals. Strategic planning 
is somewhere in-between incremental and comprehensive planning. The Department of City Planning (DCP), under 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, developed a strategic plan for the “Far West Midtown”, which outlined the development of 
the area from 8th Avenue to the Hudson River and 42nd St to West 24th street, now almost completely built. 
Subsequently the DCP produced other strategic plans in 2011 and 2018 (City of New York Department of 
Environmental Protection, 2023b). These strategies helped to outline a vision for a particular area of the city and 
encourage private development to meet these goals. These strategies often included rezonings.  
In the background of growth and global city status, however, were larger processes that were gaining the attention of 
scholars, practitioners, advocates, and residents. Sustainability and climate change concerns mounted as information 
on environmental degradation, pollution, biodiversity loss and a changing climate mounted. These trends have 
brought significant uncertainty to futures and the need to adapt quickly to major changes has become a crucial factor 
for planning success. Hence futures planning demanded the timely production of accurate information on widespread 
political, environmental, economic and societal changes (Chermack & Lynham, 2002; Varum & Melo, 2010). 
The Bloomberg administration turned the City’s attention to environmental concerns through what they termed a 
“comprehensive sustainability agenda,” which included 127 policy initiatives to achieve ten overarching goals to 
improve the infrastructure, environment, and quality of life in the city (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2007). 
PlaNYC, A Greener Greater New York was followed by the NYC Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (City 
of New York Office of the Mayor, 2013b, 2013a), another citywide report published after post-tropical storm Sandy hit 
the city. These plans were followed by the next administration, which included many of the same themes in their 
reports but put a focus on resilience and equity (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2019). 
These publications were not without critics, who argued that the mayors’ “plans” were top-down, lacked important 
social considerations, and were developed without community involvement (Angotti, 2010; Marcuse, 2011; Rosan, 
2012). While these documents lacked the elements that detractors mention, they also increased attention on the 
importance of critical infrastructure, broadened public responsibilities in provision of these services, focused on 
housing and transit-oriented development and were first steps toward addressing environmental justice for under-
resourced communities (Mandelbaum, 2007; Rosan, 2012).

The publishing of the Bloomberg and de Blasio plans also brought back interest in comprehensive futures planning 
for NYC (New York City Council’s Office of Strategic Initiatives, 2020; Soomro & Williams, 2021). The Regional Plan 
Association, working with a number of other groups, put together a comprehensive citywide planning framework that 
they claim would provide the rationale for bridging the dislocation of comprehensiveness and community participation 
for an “inclusive city” (Regional Plan Association, 2018). How comprehensive planning can offer a unified city vision 
through bottom-up participation remains unclear (Kahila-Tani et al., 2019; Wamsler et al., 2020). 
3.2 
The Emergence of Scenario Planning  
An alternative approach that has increasingly been recommended as a tool to improve urban decision-making under 
increasing uncertainty is scenario planning. Scenario planning assumes that the world is unpredictable, and no single 
plan or strategy can be relied upon to address the future. The scenario approach focuses on identifying trends and 
uncertainties, so as to allow decision makers to overcome tunnel vision and siloed thinking (Schoemaker, 1995). 
Scenario planning also makes use of community participation that helps to create alternative representations of the 
future. Hence, scenario planning has been defined by Roubelat (2000) as a networking process that challenges 
strategic paradigms and forces organizations to rethink their internal and external boundaries. According to Finn and 
Miller (Finn & Miller, 2022) the value of scenario planning derives from both its use of scientific data, but more 
importantly its use of narratives and stories to engage a diverse public in deliberations around critical issues and 
potential strategic approaches to planning for the future. As opposed to merely, or only, scientific data or quantitative 
projections of the future, scenario planning relies heavily on the power of narrative and stories to engage participants. 
The scenario approach was introduced into planning with adaptational impact assessment (Duinker & Greig, 2007) 
and formalized with the National Environmental Policy Act (National Environmental Policy Act, 1970), which had state 
and local spinoffs, including the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act (State Environmental Quality 
Review, 1975) and the New York City Environmental Quality Review Act (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 
1973). These acts required the evaluation of different environmental impacts related to the proposed project as well 
as community input. The scenario component required the developer to provide a range of alternative schemes with 
subsequent environmental impact evaluation (NYS DEC Division of Environmental Permits, 2020). Environmental 
review, however, was only initiated when projects required approval from the City for discretionary actions, such as 
the issuance of permits, City funding requests, or agency rulemaking, and therefore were not universally applied to all 
developments. 
Scenario planning was adopted widely by the mid 1990’s (Chakraborty et al., 2011). The practice has been applied in 
some international and national contexts and is now being used at the urban scale (Chakraborty & McMillan, 2015). 
For example, in NYC, scenario planning is currently beginning to be used in the NYC business community (Crain’s 
New York Business, 2022). The use of this approach has been given encouragement by the development of new 
computer tools that support spatial data and visualization (Klosterman, 2013). Moreover, the approach is the 
prescribed method in federally funded land use and transportation planning activities such as for Sustainable 
Communities Regional Planning Grants (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2011) and the Moving Ahead 
for Progress in the 21st Century program (Rep. Mica, 2012). Also, important for its increasing popularity is that 
planning groups, such as the American Planning Association (2023) and the Lincoln Land Institute (2023) are now 
supporting its implementation. 
Scenario planning is alike, but not the same as climate scenarios. While climate scenarios include descriptions of 
historical key events, the focus of scenario planning is typically on the end-state, which is envisioned prior to the 
analysis (Finn & Miller, 2022). That is, scenario planning employs a backcasting approach to understand how the 
various futures emerge. Then the process includes development of strategies to help achieve desirable futures and 
avoid undesirable ones. Moreover, future scenarios need only be “a description of a possible or probable future” and 
not be quantitatively identified (Chermack & Lynham, 2002). As such, issues to watch out for include adequate 
consideration of uncertainties, an overemphasis on “picking” a preferred future (Chakraborty et al., 2011), and a lack 
of effective public involvement (Bartholomew, 2007). Nevertheless, the usefulness of scenario planning in the urban 
context is increasingly appreciated. Questions remain, however, about how best to move forward and incorporate 
scenario approaches in both private and public planning exercises. 
We next turn to other planning frameworks that are used in the City and climate community. 
3.3 
Planning the Future Through Scenarios, Forecasts, and Projections 
Different scientific and planning communities have adopted specific tools to conceptualize and estimate futures. In 
this section, we explore the dominant tools the climate community uses to envision the future. We focus broadly on 
scenarios as a tool for examining the future. Specifically, we review projection scenarios and tools, as well as other 
exploratory and normative scenarios, visions, and futuring processes that concern (drivers of), adapting to and

responding to climate change and its impacts. Scenarios are plausible, coherent narratives about the future of a place 
or a situation that have a consistent internal logic (IPBES, 2019; Iwaniec et al., 2014; Moss et al., 2010; Reid et al., 
2005). Scenario development approaches can consider future projections (prediction or forecasts of what will 
happen), exploratory scenarios (what can happen), and/or normative future scenarios (what should happen). Some 
communities of practice use these terms interchangeably while others do not, often creating confusion in 
interdisciplinary settings. We aim to use terms as specifically as possible here. 
Projections of future conditions, sometimes called predictive scenarios or forecasts, extrapolate future conditions 
based upon predefined models of historic and existing trends. Predictive scenarios typically use quantitative models 
to suggest a specific outcome at a specific time in the future given a set of trend parameters. Examples of predictive, 
forecasted scenarios include business-as-usual projections of future land use change (Mustafa et al., 2021), NPCC 
climate and sea level rise projections (Gornitz et al., 2019), and local or national population projections, such as those 
from the NYC DCP (2013). Climate projections and international population projections provide a framework for 
understanding potential future changes with running 30-year averages centered on a decade, such as 2050s, 2080s, 
2100s (See NPCC4, Braneon et al. (Braneon et al., 2024)). In order to project the future in 80-100 years, model 
projections require quantitative historic data, which is a requirement that limits projections to basic demographic or 
climatic futures. 
Exploratory scenarios, and other normative future visions or narratives, are another important tool for cities to 
anticipate and explore climate adaptations. Exploratory scenarios are often developed in collaboration by many 
different disciplines and stakeholder communities. Thus, exploratory scenarios can be a tool to integrate diverse 
forms of data and knowledge about the future, challenge assumptions about anticipated future outcomes, integrate 
multiple drivers of change, compare alternative policies and pathways to achieve policy goals, and guide decision-
making that is flexible and robust (Elsawah et al., 2020). While based on data representing past trends, exploratory 
scenarios and visions use other methods to imagine the future and thus have more thematic flexibility and ability to 
explain futures farther out in time. 
Business-As-Usual (BAU) projections or scenarios are just that: Based on analysis of current trends using a variety of 
approaches discussed below to extrapolate emergent trajectories, this method is used both in projections and 
scenario development. Notably, the BAU conditions are often used as a baseline or reference projection or scenario 
to compare to more extreme projection assumptions or normative possibilities (Mustafa et al., 2021). 
Tools for exploring the future have been widely developed at a global scale and applied by the international scientific 
community. However, less work has been done at regional or city scales (Reimann et al., 2021; Rohat et al., 2021). 
City planners and agencies routinely engage in planning exercises for NYC, including developing a range of 
scenarios and visioning processes. In the remainder of this section, we unpack some of the key aspects of each of 
these tools, the scale at which they occur, and the themes that they cover. 
3.4 
Projecting the Future 
Prior NPCCs have made great strides in projecting future climate conditions and evaluating how risk is considered 
and planned for in the City (Solecki & Rosenzweig, 2019). Prior NPCCs have paid much less attention to scenarios 
and projections of how the built, natural, and social environment is likely to change and interact with changing climate 
hazard and other environmental conditions, though health concerns were introduced in NPCC2 (New York City Panel 
on Climate Change, 2015) and equity in NPCC3 (New York City Panel on Climate Change, 2019). Many sectors 
beyond climate variables – such as changes in the built environment and surface makeup – will influence how 
resilient or not an NYC urban future may be. Alternatives to climate futures are important for many reasons, not least 
of which is the opportunity to examine the dynamic interaction between other drivers of risk and vulnerability that are 
often created by urban development and decision-making (C. Rosenzweig & Solecki, 2018). 
Projections of future climate parameters as well as flooding and demographic conditions are critically important – if 
used together – for understanding the challenges to achieving resilience. Yet, as we describe below, they are often at 
coarse spatial and temporal resolutions and lack utility without further downscaling efforts to describe potential future 
risks at the scale of neighborhoods (and potentially by types of households). Owing to their methodological 
differences and spatial and temporal resolutions (varying from 1-hour stormwater scenarios to decadal population 
futures), projections of climate and demographic futures are not frequently used together in local planning processes 
but rely on other approaches such as scenarios (described in the following section) to connect them. It is, therefore, 
useful to begin this review with the projection efforts themselves. 
3.4.1  Climate projections 
Since its inception, the NPCC has proposed a risk management framework to mitigation and adaptation (Yohe & 
Leichenko, 2010). In the selection of emissions scenarios, NPCC’s risk management framework suggests that

10 
adaptation planning should consider outcomes with particularly adverse consequences, such as those found in 
projections that may not be likely but present high impacts. In the first report, this approach led to climate projections 
developed using the high emissions A2 scenario. Climate projections now use Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs) to identify plausible scenarios for greenhouse gas concentrations (i.e., emissions) in future 
projections of temperature and precipitation. Subsequent reports use high emissions global climate scenarios such as 
RCP8.5 to represent the high risks linked with low to no mitigation at global scales throughout the 21st century 
alongside other scenarios with lower emissions and thus lower climate-related impact (Braneon et al., 2024). 
In the IPCC AR6, there is a new framework that has been utilized to design scenarios that combine socio-economic 
and technological developments, known as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) (Riahi et al., 2017). The 
SSPs are scenarios of projected socioeconomic changes across the globe through 2100 that are consistent with 
different emissions scenarios. An experiment named the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project developed a set of 
nine scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions trajectories (O’Neill et al., 2016). These nine scenarios aggregate 
into two smaller groups; four scenarios that update the RCPs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 
5 (CMIP5), which produce equivalent radiative forcing levels (2.5, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 W/m2) and five new scenarios that 
were not included as part of the prior RCPs. NPCC4 climate projections follow this approach with the use of the AR6 
scenario framework that combines SSPs with RCPs, using the SSP5-RCP 8.5 and SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenarios, which 
represent greenhouse gas emissions pathways with 8.5 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 by end of century, respectively. These 
two scenarios replicate those used in NPCC3. 
Climate projections in NPCC were produced with the output of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations from the 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). An ensemble of 35 models across the two scenarios was used, 
producing a 70-member matrix of outputs for temperature and precipitation. This ensemble matrix was then used to 
produce projections of annual mean and extremes temperature and precipitation. GCMs produce information at 
spatial resolutions ranging from ~0.5° to ~1.5°. In order to develop projections for NYC, the data point over land that 
is closest to the city was selected to produce single-point projections. These projections are then presented as a 
range of low end (10th percentile), a middle range (25th to 75th percentile) and high end (90th percentile) estimates for 
several 30-year time slices of interest (i.e., the 2030s, 2040s, 2050s, 2060s, 2070s, 2080s). 
3.4.2 Population projections 
Population projections provide fundamental demographic information for socioeconomic and environmental outlooks. 
Using several different methods and approaches, models to project changes in population sizes, compositions, and 
spatial distributions cover a range of population trends and produce a set of plausible demographic futures. However, 
for local areas such as cities, these tend to be short-term (no more than 40 years out) (Balk et al., 2022). For 
example, the cohort-component model (Burch, 2018) is used by most state and local planning agencies as it is robust 
(i.e., replicable and verifiable), has simple data requirements (which have improved substantially in recent decades), 
and is transparent to a wide range of users (O’Neill et al., 2001). This method is based on the current size and age 
composition of the population and on assumptions of demographic change—fertility, mortality, and migration—rather 
than simply extrapolating trends in population counts over time. The cohort-component model examines not only 
change in the total population but also its demographic composition (age, sex) and sometimes other characteristics 
such as race and ethnicity (see for example, the State of California county-level projections (State of California, 
Department of Finance. Demographic Research Unit, 2023)). At a city or local level, the cohort-component model 
often encounters data limitations for population characteristics (or demographic traits) beyond age, sex, fertility, and 
mortality or cannot be applied at fine-scale geographies (such as neighborhoods or census tracts). Other models 
examine small-area population projections, such as the Hamilton-Perry Method (Hamilton & Perry, 1962) and 
methods that proportionally allocate projected city-level population to sub-city districts based on the current 
population distributions (Smith et al., 2002). Such approaches may be adequate for the short-term of 40 to 50 years 
(Swanson & Tayman, 2017), but cannot capture long term projections of population at sub-city scale. 
The Population Division of the New York City Department of City Planning (DCP), produces short-to-medium term 
population projections for NYC’s boroughs using the cohort-component model (City of New York Department of City 
Planning, 2013). These projections are part of a larger effort with the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council 
(NYMTC) (New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, 2020b), which is mandated by federal transportation 
legislation to produce county-level projections for the 31-county region for its Socioeconomic and Demographic (SED) 
forecasts to qualify for federal transportation funds, as described in Balk et al. (2022, p. 9). The methods used for the 
City’s 5-borough projection and the NYMTC ones differ somewhat from one another – primarily by use of additional 
ancillary information in downscaling methods – and therefore both are described here. The cohort-component 
demographic model used for the projections for both NYC and the 26-county region outside of NYC relies on U.S. 
census data for the base population input, so projections are typically created soon after decennial data are released. 
The most recent population projections available on DCP’s website are from 2013, which were used for the NYMTC 
2050 Socioeconomic and Demographic (SED) forecasts, and DCP was tasked in 2018 to produce interim projections 
for the NYMTC 2055 SED forecasts, which were adopted in October 2020.

NYC’s population projections were produced for each of the city’s five boroughs by age and sex with 5-year intervals 
(City of New York Department of City Planning, 2013). Inputs include average county-level fertility, mortality, and net 
migration rates. Migration, net of both international and domestic flows, was calculated using a survival-rate method. 
For all but the youngest age groups, net migration is derived as a residual by applying mortality rates and “surviving” 
an enumerated population, yielding an “expected” population for each age/sex group five or ten years later. This 
expected population is then compared to the observed or actual population; the difference, or residual, is net 
migration (from which crude migration rates are derived). For the period of the projection, fertility is assumed to be 
unchanged, while survival rates increase by one-half of the US Census Bureau’s national trend. In addition to the 
demographic model, DCP analyzes the demographic outputs in the context of a housing model to ensure that the 
resulting population could be reasonably accommodated given the City’s current land use and zoning. Through an 
iterative process, DCP adjusts the crude migration rates to bring the population and housing model in sync. 
Assumptions on land use, zoning, and housing construction act in essence to limit population growth through 
adjusting crude migration rates. DCP’s final projections are allocated down to transportation analysis zones (TAZ) 
(see https://www.nymtc.org/portals/0/pdf/SED/2040%20Final%20Draft_TAZ_report.pdf for the criteria upon which 
more than 3,500 TAZ units are defined), which are akin to census tracts and are based on projections of housing 
units and land use for these small areas. 
Similar to the NYC county-level projections, NYMTC’s projections for the 26-county region outside NYC also uses the 
cohort-component model. The migration rates for this set of counties incorporate a labor induced net migration 
adjustment to account for projected employment demand. NYMTC’s projection with its focus on transportation also 
includes many additional variables in its model, including those derived from surveys (and other sources) on 
commuting, transportation, jobs and industry development, and more (New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, 
2020a). For the 26-county region, a spatial allocation method was used to downscale population to TAZs, resulting in 
a final product that is spatially refined. Because NYMTC brings together representatives from many city and 
municipal agencies, part of the production of the final projection includes engagement with these stakeholders. The 
publicly available projections represent only one population future scenario: The scenario for NYC was based on a 
set of assumptions including current fertility levels remaining unchanged, increased survival rates based on national 
trends, and the adjusted crude migration rates by housing limits. For the non-NYC counties, the scenario was based 
on a set of assumptions including logarithmically projected fertility rates, increased survival rates based on national 
trends, and migration rates with labor induced migration adjustments (New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, 
2015). 
Additionally, DCP produces many tools and resources (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2023a) to 
interface with census data and showcase population and socioeconomic characteristics of the city from the 
neighborhood to city scale. While these tools are not intended for medium (20-40yrs)- or long-term (40-100yrs) 
population projections, they establish current patterns and trends showing spatial variation across the city, and are 
publicly available and easy to access, making them especially valuable for engagement with communities. DCP’s 
tools include Population FactFinder with profiles of local communities, as well as a map reliability calculator, which 
shows how ACS data can be used reliably. Since much of the local-area data come from the US Census American 
Community Survey (ACS) which, unlike the full census head-count data, is drawn from a representative sample, 
those data are therefore subject to sampling error (Donnelly, 2013, 2020). The tool helps users understand how to 
reliably use ACS data at small geographic levels. DCP also produces reports of short-term (recent decadal) 
neighborhood change covering important topics like migration (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2023b) 
and racial and ethnic composition (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021a). 
To date, the City’s projections do not yet include information about land use patterns associated with future climate 
(such as flood-prone regions) nor do they make assumptions about demographic futures that would be consistent 
with different emissions pathways and associated climate futures. As discussed in the next section, other tools are 
used to generate such population futures consistent with socioeconomic development pathways that are linked to 
different climate futures. These typically conform more to the specification of exploratory scenarios (even if the 
approaches blend the above methods with longer-term scenarios development) and are implemented at national or 
regional spatial scales rather than the city scale (see review in Balk et al. (Balk et al., 2022)). 
3.4.3 Health valuation  
As showcased below (BOX 4), one commonly used tool for evaluating whether a policy or investment in the future 
should be undertaken, as well as one other construct that can be used to evaluate plans or transitions to the future, is 
economic valuation of outcomes related to the impact of climate change. These tools are sometimes, but not usually, 
applied to health outcomes. Health-related costs of climate-related health conditions and deaths are not typically 
estimated, in and of themselves or as part of evaluating health or other sector policies to reduce the negative impacts 
of climate change (Limaye et al., 2019). As part of an ongoing Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation (VIA) Analysis to 
study climate change’s impacts on decision-making in NYC, a research team is reviewing published reports on the 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

12 
impacts of climate-sensitive events in NY from 2000 to 2020, then evaluating their health-related costs (McPhearson 
et al., 2024). A wider range of societal costs to NYC for care of climate-sensitive illnesses and premature loss of life 
are being developed for the city and will be reported separately. The evaluation of health-related costs will inform 
analyses of potentially avoidable, associated past, current, and future health costs under plausible climate change 
scenarios (see NPCC4, Matte et al. (Matte et al., 2024)). Such valuations can be forward-looking by accounting for 
future population shifts (e.g., more older adults) and future climate projections (e.g., more hot days). 
3.5 
Exploratory and Normative Scenarios 
Exploratory scenarios (sometimes called foresighting) explicitly consider emerging trends and uncertainties, while 
exploring a variety of possible “what if” future pathways and outcomes. Exploratory scenarios are created through 
identifying key drivers and how they might evolve based upon pathway assumptions, sometimes called storylines 
(Hunt et al., 2012; van Vuuren et al., 2012). In other words, rather than only examining ‘what is most likely’ as in 
predictive scenarios, exploratory scenarios anticipate a range of ‘what is possible’ based upon potential pathways in 
different storylines. No specific pathway has priority within the exploratory ensemble in defining the future, rather, 
exploratory scenarios are used to examine the interplay and influence of drivers. Examples of exploratory scenarios 
include the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill et al., 2014, 2020) and Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment (2005) scenarios. 
Normative scenarios are created by first defining a future target—often a desirable future outcome based on values 
and preferences that align with sustainability and resilience goals about “what should happen.” After defining the 
normative future target, the process to identify the pathways of how to get from the present to this future often occurs 
through quantitative and/or qualitative backcasting (Vergragt & Quist, 2011) or scenario-discovery techniques (Gao & 
Bryan, 2017). 
Examples of exploratory scenarios include the first ever citywide extreme rainfall driven flood projections for NYC, 
which it released as part of the first NYC Stormwater Resiliency Plan (2021). The projections include the output of a 
city-wide modeling effort to map urban flooding according to two rainfall scenarios: moderate and extreme. The 
moderate scenario corresponds to a 1-hour, 10-year storm (approximately 2 inches) and 2.5 feet of sea level rise 
above a 2000 baseline, based on the estimates for 2050 made by the NPCC. The extreme scenario corresponds to a 
1-hour, 100-year storm (approximately 3.5 inches) and 4.8 feet of sea level rise (NPCC’s 90th percentile estimate for 
2080) (Gornitz et al., 2019) (see NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al. (B. Rosenzweig et al., 2024)). The NYC Stormwater 
scenarios released publicly as maps of potential flooding extent and depth provide a first attempt at mapping a source 
of urban flood risk that, unlike coastal and riverine flooding, is not mapped and accounted for in the U.S. Federal Risk 
Rating Map (Qiang et al., 2017). The release of these exploratory scenarios to examine potential future flood risk 
driven by extreme rainfall, however, focus on flooding in right-of-way locations such as streets and sidewalks, while 
private parcels, parks, and highways were not considered due to a lack of data related to their drainage infrastructure. 
This omission highlights ongoing data limitations for such detailed climate risk scenarios and both the need for 
improved data sources to support such model driven scenarios, but also for a plurality of scenario approaches to 
envision alternative futures for NYC. 
3.5.1 Plausible versus desirable futures 
In scenario development, it is understood that the future cannot always be accurately predicted and that many futures 
are likely. Thus, future visions for inclusive climate resilience must integrate perspectives across multiple sectors, 
scales, and communities to ensure a plurality of ideas, innovations, and actions. Moreover, positive, desirable visions 
are needed to guide urban planning as a counter to negative discourse on expected urban futures if there are no 
interventions. The process of positive visioning involves creativity, allows for radical departure from the status quo, 
and focuses on the pathways needed to achieve desirable outcomes. Building on the more sustainable, low-carbon 
lifestyle afforded by NYC’s compact urban form, walkable neighborhoods, and transit access, a positive future 
scenario framing can be used to compare multiple, alternative future goals, pathways, and outcomes. Through 
positive visioning, we can explore both plausible and desirable futures. 
Plausible and desirable futures look beyond just what is likely to happen and allow us to consider what is possible. 
Plausible futures address how we would like to respond, while accounting for the existing context and future projected 
challenges. In contrast, desirable, or aspirational, futures integrate normative perspectives on what the future should 
look like (Iwaniec et al., 2020). Desirable or aspirational visions typically have a long-term (multi-decadal) time 
horizon. The longer time horizon in future visioning is critical to overcome political barriers and allow adequate time 
and resources for the reconstruction of infrastructure and buildings (e.g., electrification of energy services). Examples 
include NYC 80x50 roadmap (City of New York, 2016).

13 
Plausible visions can focus on short or longer-term actions. The plausible near-term actions can either be consistent 
with a desirable long-term vision (e.g., NYC streets master plan) or can lock-in or amplify maladaptive patterns of 
development (e.g., widening highways (Weinberger, 2022)). Just as some current policies and features are the result 
of decades of incremental change and are now understood to be maladaptive, near-term, feasible and desirable 
incremental changes can help build a pathway to a desirable future and avoid or reverse maladaptation. 
3.5.2 Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) exploratory scenarios 
Climate projections use Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to identify plausible futures for greenhouse 
gas concentrations in future projections of temperature and precipitation. Similarly, the Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathways (SSP) describe alternative future socio-economic and demographic visions (BOX 1) consistent with those 
RCPs (O’Neill et al., 2020). Alternative spatial population projections are important for examining potential future 
changes in land use and land cover, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, transit, and water availability that will 
have compounding and differential impacts on climate hazard exposure throughout the city (Güneralp & Seto, 2013; 
MacManus et al., 2021; R. I. McDonald et al., 2011; Meiyappan et al., 2014; Riahi et al., 2011; Sampedro et al., 2022; 
Shepard et al., 2012). Each SSP scenario represents a plausible and unique future based on estimates of future 
fertility, mortality, or education (KC & Lutz, 2014, 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2017) and assumptions about the spatial 
pattern of development and population distributions. Typically, the SSP’s and demographic forecasting have been 
applied globally, and more work is needed to examine future population scenarios at a regional and city level (Balk et 
al., 2022; Hauer, 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Kebede et al., 2018; Rohat et al., 2019; Striessnig et al., 2019). In 
particular, the SSP-RCP-SPA scenario framework has been used to construct local scenarios of particular outcomes 
(such as heat-related mortality) in Boston, MA and Houston, TX (Lino et al., 2019; Rohat et al., 2019) and 
infrastructure in Tokyo, Japan (Kamei et al., 2019).  
The relationship between the RCPs and SSPs is visualized in Figure 1. Panel (a) compares RCPs in order of 
increasing mitigation action (Y-axis) and SSP narratives in order of increasing mitigation challenges (X-axis). The 
boxes represent the extent to which Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) were able to successfully reach the RCP 
target within the greenhouse gas futures described by the SSP (Hausfather, 2018). For example, the numbers in the 
RCP 2.6/SSP3 box (0/4) indicates that four IAMs tried to achieve RCP 2.6 within the SSP3 narrative, and none was 
successful. Conversely, the four IAMs associated with RCP 3.4/SSP3 were all successful in reaching the RCP target. 
Panel (b) illustrates energy use in 2100 by IAM (along the bottom) for each SSP (along the top). Energy sources 
embedded within each IAM are color coded in the bars (Hausfather, 2018). 
Panel (c) is an overarching view of the SSP-RCP Scenario Framework, which integrates the climate futures 
described by Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), societal futures described by Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathways (SSPs), and climate policy responses represented by Shared Climate Policy Assumptions (SPAs) into a 
unified research framework (O’Neill et al., 2020). 
Importantly, a future with low mitigation (therefore appearing to the right side of Figure 1, Panel a, as having high 
mitigation challenges) – which is represented by RCP 8.5 – is only found in one of the SSP narratives (i.e., SSP5). 
NPCC4 climate forecast includes RCP 8.5, and therefore the population projection should also include an SSP5 
future, along with other SSPs (NPCC4 climate projects also use an RCP of 4.5.). Results of research underway that 
spatially project population out to 2100 for NYC consistent with RCP 4.5 (SSP2 and SSP3) and RCP 8.5 (SSP5) is 
reviewed in Section 5.

BOX 1: A brief description of five global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 
SSP1 is a sustainable future. There is greater investment in education and health, and consequently greater equity; consumption in 
SSP1 is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity. 
In an SSP2 world, future patterns do not deviate much from historical patterns. Population growth is moderate, leveling off after 
mid-century. While some countries thrive in economic growth, others do not. Income inequality persists or improves slowly and 
vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remains. 
An SSP3 world is focused on competitiveness and security. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within 
their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on 
domestic or, at most, regional issues. Investments in education and technology decline, economic development is slow, 
consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized but high in 
developing countries. 
SSP4 sees highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political 
power, leading to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between the 
globally connected knowledge and capital-intensive sectors and society, and fragmented lower-income, poorly educated societies 
that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Environmental policies focus on local issues in middle- and high-income areas. 
SSP5 relies on competitive markets, innovation, and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and 
development of human capital. The path to sustainable development is integrated with global markets and strong investments in 
health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. These goals are coupled with the exploitation of abundant 
fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles. Together, these lead to rapid growth of the global 
economy. Population peaks and then declines by the end of the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are 
successfully managed. 
Full descriptions in Riahi et al. (2017) and Hausfather (2018). 
NYC has used a variety of different exploratory scenarios in some sectors. Notably, the NYC Mayor’s Office has 
articulated a series of visions, actions, and exploratory scenarios in the OneNYC 2050 Building Strong and Fair City 
report. OneNYC 2050 highlights goals for future just and equitable governance, economy, health, education, transit 
and housing services, and infrastructure, while acknowledging the impacts of future climate change (City of New York 
Office of the Mayor, 2019).  
Another example comes from the NYC Housing Authority which uses advanced planning approaches driven by 
concerns about climate impacts and vulnerability. In 2014, NYCHA created an office of Recovery and Resilience 
within the Capital Projects Division to address damage from post-tropical storm Sandy, build resilience within 
buildings to similar storms that may occur in the future, and to analyze and advise on future climate hazards for the 
Authority. In 2020, after an examination of NPCC’s climate projections, NYCHA analyzed vulnerabilities and 
developed a set of strategies with seven key goals including: enhancing resilience into NYCHA’s capital budget, 
fostering the health the NYCHA’s urban forests, expanding reliable, efficient cooling in NYCHA apartments, preparing 
NYCHA structures for heavier, more frequent flooding, protecting critical infrastructure at developments exposed to 
coastal flooding, preparing for additional hazards including rising groundwater and extreme winds, and investing in 
social resilience across NYCHA campuses. 
The DCP has been working with communities throughout the flood hazard areas of NYC to identify zoning and land 
use strategies to help to reduce flood risk. This includes proposals to make permanent and improve upon existing 
zoning rules that were adopted on a temporary, emergency basis following Sandy. These zoning rules were formally 
adopted in 2021 (Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency, 2021). This strategy would enable new and existing buildings 
to comply with zoning and building code requirements in order to be better prepared to withstand future storms. 
Additionally, DCP recommended expanding the applicability of zoning rules to include areas that will be subject to 
high-risk flooding in the future. Doing so would allow buildings that are not currently required to meet flood resilient 
construction standards to also make resiliency improvements in advance of being mapped within the 1% annual 
chance floodplain. Finally, DCP also developed guides for flood-resistant building construction in urban areas. 
While adaptation is an important climate goal it is clear from current planning in the City and from community-based 
plans that adaptation must also be implemented with equity as a goal. These two goals can sometimes be in conflict. 
For example, gentrification, or the displacement of populations from neighborhoods due to rising property values, 
increasing rents, upzoning, and other core gentrification drivers can also be partly related to greening and climate 
policies, an increasing concern among vulnerable communities in NYC (see NPCC4, Foster et al. (Foster et al., 
2024)). There are examples of community residents who resist green infrastructure in their neighborhood because of 
concerns that greening may be part of a mix of drivers causing potential displacement. Communities, planners,

academics, and the City have noted that resilience planning must include ways in which members of the community 
can also benefit from climate and greening policies (Amorim-Maia et al., 2022; Bautista et al., 2020; City of New York 
Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2023; City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023; Riverkeeper, 
2022). 
4 Futures Planning Considering New York City as a 
Complex System 
Transforming NYC to be flexible, adaptive, and resilient requires the capacity to build, design, and plan for complexity 
(Chester et al., 2023; McPhearson, 2020). Cities have many interacting and interdependent social-economic, 
ecological-biophysical, and technological-infrastructure systems and NYC is at risk from climate change precisely 
because of its dense concentration of people, infrastructure, and economies. A key challenge is understanding and 
governing this complexity, with the additional pressure of climate change (Meadows, 2008) and imagining, planning, 
and implementing solutions that will be robust in the real-world context of the complex social-ecological-technological 
systems (SETS) of NYC is critical (McPhearson, Pickett, et al., 2016; Pineda-Pinto et al., 2021). Importantly this is the 
approach taken in the IPCC’s 6th Assessment (Figure 2) to address the complex and cascading impacts of rapid-
onset events (e.g., storm surge) and slow-onset chronic events (e.g., everyday flooding) that are likely to occur in 
cities (Dodman et al., 2022). Since cities are complex systems characterized by irreducible uncertainty, emergent 
properties, and non-linear behavior that can respond to and learn from changing conditions (Alberti et al., 2018), 
framing cities as complex SETS provides a conceptual foundation for examining how SETS dimensions interact and 
affect their individual and collective contributions to climate risk and resiliency.

risk and can limit or enable solutions. Source: IPCC Working Group II, Chapter 6 (Dodman et al., 2022, fig. 6.2).

Emerging urban systems science uses models and frameworks to make sense of the real-time dynamics of complex 
systems. To ensure that climate solutions don’t create unintended trade-offs, or maladaptation, it is important to 
account for the interdependencies among social, ecological, and technological infrastructure components of urban 
systems (E. M. Cook & McPhearson, 2020; Grabowski et al., 2017; Grimm et al., 2016, 2017; McPhearson, Haase, et 
al., 2016; McPhearson, 2020; McPhearson et al., 2021, 2022a). Most traditional scientific approaches to improving 
resilience are siloed, with analytical efforts focused on one or two domains. Yet, as recent events have shown, 
extreme events can cause cascading impacts across domains. For example, flooding can simultaneously cause 
power and transportation disruptions, damage ecosystems, impact human health, and damage homes and critical 
infrastructure. Recent extreme events demonstrated failures or inadequacies not just in the built infrastructure but 
also in resources, institutions, information, and governance systems—components of the urban SETS—to prepare 
for, and respond to, events of this magnitude (Eakin et al., 2018). To advance governance for resilience means also 
advancing our ability to understand such complex urban dynamics and develop near and longer-term scenarios to 
guide decision-making.  
The SETS framework builds on literature that demonstrates that social and ecological systems are linked through 
feedback mechanisms, and display resilience and complexity. Transitions in these literatures are commonly 
considered as co-evolution processes that require multiple changes in social-ecological or social-technological 
systems. Modeling approaches, such as machine learning, spatial projection, and mixed statistical approaches have 
been developed to explain how different policy mixes influence social–ecological or social–technical change. 
Complementing recent scholarship in social–technical or social–ecological systems research, the SETS conceptual 
framework has been used in multiple adaptation and sustainability planning process and policies – in Atlanta, 
Phoenix, New York, and San Juan (PR) – to examine the interactions and interdependencies between humans, the 
environment, and technological–infrastructure. It can be a way to analyze the potential of positive seeds of 
transformation to grow toward larger scale and more substantial changes. 
In 2020, the U.S. National Science Foundation issued a call for Sustainable Regional Systems research and argued 
for SETS as the conceptual foundation to anchor systems approaches that can deliver sustainability across urban 
and rural interlinked systems (National Science Foundation, 2020). SETS aims to overcome the limitation of a purely 
socio-technological approach which tends to exclude ecological functions, or of social–ecological approaches which 
may overlook critical roles of technology and infrastructure, all of which are fundamental constituents and drivers of 
urban system dynamics. The SETS framework can therefore broaden the spectrum of the options available for more 
systemic identification of barriers (within existing actions, governance frameworks, economic constraints, and value 
systems) and generation of solutions for sustainable futures. 
For example, processes, challenges, and solutions related to green gentrification can be addressed through a SETS 
approach. Community concerns are rising about green gentrification where urban greening efforts can be seen as 
potentially driving displacement of low income and minority populations. This perception is due to well understood 
impacts of neighborhood greening through tree planting, park development and investment, that can drive increases 
in real estate values and thus lead to increased costs of rent, taxes, and home ownership (Anguelovski et al., 2022; 
Keeler et al., 2019). To ensure that urban greening for climate adaptation and resilience does not result in 
displacement or negative outcomes for equity and justice suggests a clear need for more systemic and convergent 
approaches to adaptation that couple planning, policymaking, and decision-making across sectors and governance 
silos. Urban greening thus requires more than ecological investments in a neighborhood (Wolch et al., 2014). A SETS 
approach suggests that converging priorities for tree planting or park upgrades with solutions to eliminate risk of 
displacement would mean coupling greening with rent subsidies, low-income housing investments, and other 
approaches that cut across sectors, agencies, and nodes for decision-making. Plans and policies that couple 
greening, social policy, affordable housing, and other related dynamics in neighborhoods facing multiple challenges is 
an ongoing need and challenge for climate adaptation solutions to take up more convergent, systemic approaches to 
building resilience in NYC. 
4.1 
Diverse Sector and Cross-Sector Needs: Understanding Trade-offs Between 
Spatial and Temporal Scales and Thematic Breadth 
NYC is part of a larger urban system comprising the greater metro area. Considering relationships and 
interdependencies at the neighborhood, city, and regional spatial scales, as well as in near- and longer-term 
timeframes, is essential for advancing resilience and avoiding maladaptation. 
Figure 3 shows the spatial and temporal scales for a range of government and community plans to better understand 
the landscape of NYC resilience plans and identifies the timelines of community-based and government climate 
adaptation and resilience plans for NYC. The timelines highlight the spatial (neighborhood, city, regional, state) and 
temporal (short-, mid-, and long-term) scales and the climate hazard(s) each plan addresses (extreme heat,

stormwater, coastal flooding, and multi-hazard). 
 
 
Figure 3: Government-based (Upper) and community-based and non-governmental (Lower) climate adaptation and resilience plans 
based on their spatial and temporal scales and the climate hazard(s) they address. Note – this is not a comprehensive review of all 
community-based and government climate adaptation and resilience plans, rather it focuses on selected plans showing recent (from 
2019 on) plans or plans still in-use. The timescale was identified by whether the plans included specific targets/deadlines for their 
strategies. If no long-term time scale was explicitly stated in the plan, they were assumed to be shorter-term. However, it’s important 
to note that many if not all of the shorter-term plans will have lasting and long-term impacts when implemented. (Figure from NPCC 
authors) 
Some planning initiatives by government agencies (shown in upper portion of Figure 3), especially those focused on 
sectors such as environment, energy, and water systems, have considered regional scale dynamics and has 
produced plans targeted for the region or state (Pirani et al., 2018; Regional Plan Association, 2018). The timelines of 
plans in NYC highlight that the included community-based plans mostly address multi-hazard climate impacts, as 
compared to the government-based plans, which explicitly focus on both individual hazards and multi-hazard 
planning approaches. Although there are fewer government plans with an explicit multi-hazard focus, many hazard-
specific government plans will likely address multiple hazards through stated strategies. When comparing the 
temporal scales, the community-based plans (shown in the lower portion of Figure 3) generally take a shorter-term 
focus, compared to the somewhat longer-term nature of some of the government-based plans. The community-based 
plans that bring together multiple community organizations in a single plan, such as Rise to Resilience, tend to have a 
longer-term focus. However, long-term planning remains a gap in both city government and community-based 
planning.

4.2 
Community-centered Climate Resilience Planning 
Community-based organizations in NYC, such as the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, The Rockaway Initiative 
for Sustainability and Equity (RISE), UPROSE, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice, are generating their own 
climate and sustainability plans that address concerns from transportation to energy to heat resilience. The vast 
majority of these plans include strategies that are within a short to medium-term time frame. Community-based plans 
are generally place-based, allowing for a more tailored and contextualized approach to addressing climate resilience 
based on specific neighborhood characteristics that can complement more general, broader city-level planning 
efforts. There is an opportunity to further build out and institutionalize the integration and centering of community-
based plans in citywide agendas so that they are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Figure 3 highlights a few 
examples of community-based resilience plans and strategies and BOX 2 describes examples of climate resilience 
planning and agenda setting by diverse community-centered initiatives throughout NYC since 2020. For a more in-
depth description of how these plans are being implemented on the ground, see NPCC4, Foster et al. (Foster et al., 
2024). 
As an effort to synthesize community-centered resilience goals, Regional Plan Association and Environmental 
Defense Fund worked with partners and stakeholders to identify climate resilience goals that have been articulated 
through community-based plans in areas at risk of coastal flooding. As part of this initiative, the team has also 
identified potential indicators that could be used to measure progress toward those goals. While there are many 
accepted measures or indicators of sea level rise, increased frequency of extreme events, rising temperatures and 
targets for greenhouse gas reductions, there are few established measurable targets for resilience to those climate 
impacts—particularly examined across spatial scales for communities and cities. Without measurable goals, targets, 
and data at a suitable scale for effectively redressing these risks, government officials and advocates alike are unable 
to effectively assess, track, and implement solutions. An online map, the NYC Climate Resilience Plan Mapper 
(Regional Plan Association, 2023) highlights the community-led climate resilience work in the context of government-
led and academic plans. This project aims to lay the groundwork for the development of specific resilience 
performance measures or targets that are evidence-based, community-informed, easily updated, and could be used 
to support advocacy and decision-making over time. Further, the project also seeks to understand the similarities and 
differences between how communities, governments, and scientists define resilience goals.

BOX 2: Community-centered climate resilience planning and policy agendas. 
These examples of climate resilience planning and agenda setting by diverse community-centered initiatives throughout NYC since 
2020 highlight a range of initiatives developed by individual community-based organizations and collaborative coalitions across 
many organizations, and range in scope from local neighborhood to regional scale and from near-term to longer-term planning.

Focus: Recommending strategies to bolster the City’s Green Infrastructure Program to improve stormwater management during 
precipitation events and maximize co-benefits and equitable outcomes 
Process: Riverkeeper led the development of the recommendations in partnership with community-based organizations such as 
Bronx River Alliance, Gowanus Canal Conservancy, the HOPE Program, NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, and more, and 
reviewed by City agencies like DEP, DOT, and Parks 
Time frame: Near-term focus on NYC’s Green Infrastructure Program 2030 milestone requirements  
Example strategies: Some recommendations include prioritizing long-term maintenance and maintenance jobs, increasing 
interagency coordination, expanding green infrastructure development, changing the rate structure for water, increasing funding, 
creating public education campaigns, and evaluating all opportunities for stream daylighting. 
2023 Extreme Heat Policy Agenda (WE ACT for Environmental Justice, 2023) 
Focus: Addressing extreme heat impacts across all of NYC, especially for groups that are disproportionately affected such as 
people of color, low-income households, and elderly people  
Process: WE ACT for Environmental Justice developed the policy agenda and collaborates with government agencies to 
implement recommendations     
Time frame: Near-term (WE ACT sets an annual extreme heat policy agenda) 
Example strategies: Policy recommendations range from expanding the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) 
to subsidize summer utility bills, to codifying and promoting cooling centers, coordinating emergency planning and communications, 
increasing green infrastructure and renewable energy, and supporting City policy reform.

Green Resilient Industrial District (GRID) Plan 2.0: A Just Transition Plan for Sunset Park (UPROSE, 2023) 
Focus: A plan for a just transition to decarbonizing Sunset Park in Brooklyn that centers local economic development and prioritizes 
resilience to air pollution, extreme heat, and flooding 
Process: In 2022, urban planning firm Integrated Urban Equity Solutions (IUES) updated the 2019 GRID plan, which was originally 
developed by urban planners in the CCCE for UPROSE and the Protect Our Working Waterfront Alliance (POWWA)  
Time frame: Near- to mid-term to 2035 
Example strategies: Strategies leverage the unique neighborhood assets and support frontline communities in participating in a 
just green and clean energy economy. Other focus areas range from building grassroots and institutional capacity, promoting 
transportation justice, and expanding transformative decision making that is matriarchal, intergenerational, and rooted in ancestral 
knowledge. 
4.3 
Multi-Hazard Scenario Planning: Adaptation Scenarios 2021 for Multi-Hazard, 
Cross-Sectoral and Long-Term Scenario Planning in New York City 
An example of multi-sector, multi-scalar city-led planning includes the NYC Adaptation Scenarios for 2100 (E. Cook 
et al., 2022). Much of the dominant discourse about future forecasts is negative with visions of environmental and 
societal collapse, and “business as usual” forecasts that challenge planning and policymaking for more optimistic 
urban futures. Climate hazard projections in NYC can often paint a picture of a future city that is difficult or impossible 
to adapt to – and thereby may be considered dystopian. Such perceived inevitability of a negative future can become 
a barrier to action and long-term planning (Iwaniec et al., 2020; McPhearson, Iwaniec, et al., 2016). Ultimately, such 
dominant discourses may become self-fulfilling with negative future visions driving the city towards a negative future 
reality. However, research and practice demonstrate the role of positive visions that allow exploration of alternative 
and desirable futures to assist in developing positive plans, goals, and targets and delivering desirable outcomes for 
cities. Without shared positive visions for the future, it is unlikely that plans made now will achieve the equity, justice, 
sustainability, and resilience goals desired for the future of NYC and its communities.  
In order to create space for positive visions, it is helpful to look to time frames far enough into the future in order to 
remove the present constraints that often make it hard to imagine desirable, normative futures. Existing planning 
efforts often focus on goals that are only 10, 20, or possibly 30 years into the future. While these shorter-term 
planning efforts will have long-lasting impacts, many future aspirations will take even longer to achieve, and short-
term planning is not the same as setting long-term goals. Participatory processes are critical in co-developing shared 
visions that bring together diverse perspectives and forms of knowledge (E. Cook et al., 2022) (see BOX 3).

BOX 3: SETS Convergence Research Network 
In Fall 2021, the New York City (NYC) Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ) partnered with the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) Convergence Research Network to facilitate the NYC 
Climate Adaptation Scenarios workshop series (E. Cook et al., 2022). Approximately 35 government practitioners from city, state, 
and federal agencies co-developed six distinct positive future visions for NYC in 2100 that are more just, equitable, and resilient in 
the face of extreme climate challenges. The envisioned future scenarios addressed: Multiple co-occurring hazards, Coastal 
flooding, Extreme heat, Winter extremes, Extreme precipitation, and Drought and shifting water demand. The goal of each future 
scenario was to radically transform the city’s social, environmental, and physical infrastructure—including governance, green 
infrastructure, and water-energy-transit systems—and the City’s ability to respond to extreme events. 
We used a 2100 timeframe of approximately 80 years from today to create a rare space for long-term planning and positive 
visioning. Ultimately, the workshop activities were designed to develop long-term future visions that imagine what the future ought 
to be and consider more transformative strategies to achieve those visions without being constrained by the inner workings of the 
current system. Participants worked in small groups to envision six scenarios for the future of NYC in 2100. Scenario themes were 
developed in response to practitioner concerns and the City’s sustainability and environmental management plans.  
Participants envisioned a future NYC that is resilient to multi-hazard risks from extreme heat, precipitation, and drought with 
reliable, resilient, and interconnected infrastructure. The interconnected infrastructure addresses multiple risks and combines green 
and gray infrastructure solutions. The envisioned future infrastructure, including use of renewable technologies and nature-based 
solutions, will be interconnected and enable flexibility during co-occurring events. The interconnected systems will allow safer failure 
or a minimum service provisioning that avoids complete failures. In addition, a social contract would establish an inclusive and 
transformative governance system built on principles of trust, agility, and accountability. The inclusive governance system will 
integrate community participation, expertise, and cross-agency collaboration to better address future co-occurring hazards. Finally, 
this scenario envisioned that all New Yorkers would have equitable access to physical health, mental well-being, and economic 
stability that is not dependent on zip code, race, and privilege in order to be better equipped in the face of future events. 
To ensure a future NYC that is resilient to coastal flooding and storms, participants envisioned collaborative governance based 
on a public-private-civic governance model to facilitate coordination across agencies and cross-sectorial decision-making. This 
future vision ensures residents are more resilient to future flooding through a variety of mechanisms, including equitable 
opportunities for relocation, housing, and flood insurance. Finally, this future focuses on a systems approach to developing a 
retrofitted city that integrates natural elements of nature-based solutions with hard, engineered infrastructure. The retrofitted city is 
centered on solutions that provide co-benefits and are multifunctional. Through a social-ecological-technological systems approach, 
the city’s design integrates ecological elements and nature-based solutions, together with human health and well-being goals, into 
the built environment. This ‘engineered with nature’ approach spans policy, operation, maintenance, research, and design. The 
primary objectives include flexible or agile buildings or structures that are safe-to-fail, are able to buffer storm surges, sequester 
carbon, and do not emit contaminants. 
Participants envisioned a future NYC that is resilient to rising temperatures and extreme heat would eliminate heat-related 
illness and mortality through a combination of infrastructure and health reforms. The future scenario relies on and maximizes the 
use of green vegetation and water features to mitigate heat. It ensures excess heat waste (e.g., from air conditioning) is reduced or 
reused through heat recovery systems to minimize new energy use. This will be achieved through updated building code to, for 
example, require the use of passive or low-energy building design, reduce the use of absorptive materials, and require green roof 
installation retrofits. 
A future NYC that is resilient to winter extremes would minimize community vulnerability and improve preparedness. In addition, 
the future will maximize public well-being and mental health, ensuring residents are prepared for winter weather and can enjoy its 
benefits. Finally, the future will rely on investing in zero-carbon infrastructure. A three-pronged approach will be used to meet this 
zero-carbon infrastructure goal. First, a broad range of infrastructure will be built to withstand the increasing frequency of freeze-
thaw cycles. Second, all infrastructure will meet decarbonization standards, including by utilizing fossil fuel-free energy sources, 
electrifying equipment, and overall regulating retrofits. There will be a particular focus on clean and reliable heating sources to 
reduce disruptions and increase resiliency during winter extremes. Finally, all infrastructure will also meet design standards that limit 
ecosystem harm – by phasing out the use of salt on icy sidewalks and roads.  
To be resilient to extreme precipitation, participants envisioned that residents have agency in decision making to enhance 
individual and community resilience. New Yorkers would have the information, infrastructure, and ability to be both mobile and 
stable in the case of an extreme rain event. There would be prioritized and expanded affordable housing in low flood risk areas. In 
addition, the City will embrace living with water through integrated watershed management and combined natural-green and hard-
engineered infrastructure to convey water in times of heavy rainfall. The focus will be on managing stormwater efficiently through 
integrated ecosystem-based and engineered solutions. Urban neighborhoods will be connected with natural systems and semi-
naturalized streetscapes to recreate a natural watershed for stormwater conveyance and recreation. A network of compensated 
green stewards would help to manage these landscapes, eventually leading to the establishment of land trusts. With fewer cars on 
the road, transportation spaces like highways and tunnels could be repurposed for water conveyance.

Finally, participants envisioned a future NYC that is resilient to drought and shifting water demand that promotes the regional 
approach to maintain freshwater supply, ensures that all New Yorkers have equitable access to clean water, and minimizes potable 
water waste to protect water quality and quantity. In particular, landscapes are conserved and managed to be resilient and 
conserve water. For example, a shift to drought tolerant vegetation helps to protect water supply by reducing outdoor water use and 
enhances the resilience of the ecological system to severe drought conditions. The future also focuses on stormwater and water 
reuse infrastructures to ensure resilient water use and quality in the urban environment. Public, residential, and commercial 
properties will capture greywater and rainwater for on-site use and all water runoff from impervious surfaces is managed for future 
banking and security. 
5 What Do We Know About the Future? 
The future climate of NYC is described in the NPCC4 Climate Science Special Report (Braneon et al., 2024) and in 
this assessment (Balk et al., 2024). In short, NYC will be hotter, stormier and with greater variability in precipitation, 
and with rising coastal hazards. The spatial distribution of hazards is not evenly distributed across the city – for 
example, extreme heat is experienced differently and disproportionately. As shown in the NPCC4, Climate Science 
2024 report (Braneon et al., 2024), indoor extreme heat exposure is a critical driver of heat related mortality and 
hospitalization, and yet there is limited work dedicated to monitoring and projecting indoor thermal environments that 
exacerbate outdoor heat in the present day, let alone to estimate such potential impacts in the future under warmer 
conditions (Braneon et al., 2024). In this section, we assess the current knowledge about the socio-demographic, 
built environment, health, and nature-based futures of the city.  
5.1 
Demographic Futures 
Because of the work of the DCP, we know a good deal about the population distribution and composition, change in 
the recent past and projections a few decades into the future. This section begins with a short discussion of that but 
then transitions into uses the SSP framework to project population mid-century and beyond. 
5.1.1 The population of New York City is getting older and more diverse 
The population of NYC in 2020 was over 8.8 million persons, with more than half of the population residing in 
Brooklyn and Queens. Aging is a national trend, and NYC is no exception. Between 2010 and 2020, the median age 
increased from 35.5 to 37.3 (38.1) years (5-year estimate. 1-year estimate in parentheses) (Matte et al., 2024; United 
States Census Bureau, 2021). In 2013, NYC DCP (2013) projected the population in 2040 to reach 9 million 
persons1. According to the 2013 DCP projections, the share of population over age 65 was 12.2% in 2010 and is 
projected to rise to 15.6% by 2040. Placing this in historical perspective, 7.7% of the city’s population was over age 
65 in 1950. 
Growth in the population of NYC comes largely from natural increase, that is births minus deaths, as the city has a 
long-standing pattern of migration losses – more people move out of the city than move in – consistent from the mid-
twentieth century onward (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2013, 2022). “The net outflow from the city 
in the past decade totaled just 51,000, but it was a result of a remarkable population churn, with 2.57 million people 
moving to NYC and 2.62 million people leaving” (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2023b). Population 
growth is not uniform by race and ethnic composition: “NYC’s Hispanic population growth reflected the citywide 
pattern, with natural increase outstripping net outflows. Asian population growth bucked the trend, with both natural 
increase and net inflows, resulting in dramatic increases across the boroughs. There were population declines among 
the White and Black populations as natural increase only partially offset net outflows” (City of New York Department 
of City Planning, 2023b).  
Figure 4 shows the long-standing and increasing diversity of NYC. In the past decade, the Asian population grew by 
nearly 350,000, accounting for 55 percent of the city’s growth, and the Hispanic population, which increased by about 
150,000, accounted for about one-quarter of the city’s growth over the decade. The White population remained 
relatively unchanged (declining slightly) whereas the Black population decreased by 84,000. The remainder of the 
population growth is accounted for by those identifying as two or more races or some other race. 
 
 
1 There is inherent uncertainty in projecting the future: DCP’s 2013 projection of the 2020 population to be 8.55 million – somewhat 
lower than the actual 2020 population  – and it projected the 2030 population to be around the current-day population, but given the 
current estimate of the 2022 population of around 8.4 million (City of New York, 2023a) these estimates may turn out to be on 
target.

Department of City Planning, 2023b) 
Population aging, migration, and diversity result from larger social processes. Population aging is expected to 
continue with high certainty into the future and while NYC has long been home to migrants from places throughout 
the US and abroad, forecasting future migration streams is much harder than projecting future age structure. The 
NYMTC Socioeconomic and Demographic (SED) projections for 2055 “show both employment and population 
growing regionwide from 2017 to the 2055 forecast year. Employment, although lagged in the near term to 
acknowledge the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, will exceed that projected in earlier forecasts” (New 
York Metropolitan Transportation Council, 2020b). Growth rates in the region also slow later in the period, due to 
population aging. 
Additional socioeconomic characteristics are important from a climate vulnerability perspective – such as levels and 
trends in change in income (and wealth) distribution, new, available, and affordable housing units, and job growth. 
New York University’s Furman Center has produced city-wide indicators (2023) (as well as neighborhood level) of 
housing characteristics, median income and inequality metrics from 2000-2021. In these two decades, they find 
increases in homeowners (from 30.2 to 33.3%) concomitant with even larger increases in the proportion of 
households that are rent-burdened (from 23.7 to 30.1%), with substantial increases outside Manhattan since 1980 
(Balk et al., 2022). While recent trends are a good indicator of conditions in the near term, apart from using new 
building permits in the NYMTC forecasts, such socioeconomic factors have not typically been forecast in the medium 
or long-term. 
5.1.2 The spatial distribution of population in New York City 
DCP’s projections for NYC are for the total population for each borough by age and sex. Projections are not done by 
race or ethnic composition but are available for the total population down to the transportation analysis zone (TAZ) 
level, which are akin to census tracts and can be reaggregated in spatial units useful to particular user groups. Apart 
from their projections, in their recent neighborhood analysis, DCP (2023b) finds that ‘Roughly half of neighborhoods 
experienced net outflows [from 2010-2020]. The vast majority of these still experienced population growth through 
natural increase, reflecting the citywide pattern of population growth despite net migration losses.” DCP also 
undertakes periodic analysis of the dynamics of racial and ethnic composition of NYC neighborhoods (City of New 
York Department of City Planning, 2021a). NYC’s remarkably diverse population is not evenly dispersed (nor has it 
ever been) across boroughs or neighborhoods. To understand neighborhood change, DCP also examines decadal 
change in new construction at the neighborhood level and places these in the context of the change in the racial and 
ethnic composition of neighborhoods (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2021b), information essential for 
understanding climate impacts with a racial justice lens despite the short-term nature of the change analysis. 
5.1.3 Demographic futures consistent with different SSPs 
In thinking about the future climate of NYC, and the ability to adapt to it, it is also important to understand the 
population futures that are consistent with those different climate futures, and the pathways that jointly lead to them.

Thus, this assessment makes use of new population projections consistent with three SSPs (Jiang et al., 2020) – 
SSP2, SSP3 and SSP5 – and which were downscaled to 1km spatial resolution (Zoraghein & O’Neill, 2020a, 2020b) 
for the United States. To project the future, and as an important improvement on global applications, US-state-
specific inputs on fertility, mortality and migration are used to project future population and a set of state-specific 
modelling parameters for urban and rural spatial distributions in downscaling the projections to 1km grid. Adapting 
these three SSPs to the US states, SSP2 is characterized by medium population growth including medium levels of 
fertility, mortality, and international migration; SSP3 evolves with low population growth due to low fertility and 
international migration but higher mortality; and SSP5 sees higher population growth due to high fertility and 
international migration along with low mortality (Jiang et al., 2020) (See BOX 1 for additional narratives describing 
these three scenarios). 
Table 1 displays the results of those new data for NYC and State. The three scenarios not only produce different 
expected population totals and age distributions (Figure 5) as well as much different spatial distributions (Figure 6). 
One of the three scenarios, SSP2 – a “middle of the road”  scenario (in terms of the assumptions it makes about 
demographic futures, and one that resembles recent (2000-2010) historical trends that remain constant over time), 
envisions that by mid-century the population of NYC will be about the same as present day and modest increases to 
the end of the century. Another, SSP3, envisions a less populous city, whereas SSP5 envisions an increase of over 
an additional million New Yorkers. This pattern continues to 2100 where SSP3 produces a much less populous and 
SSP5 produces a much more populous NYC. Table 1 places these changes in the context of projections for the state 
as whole. The population of NYC in the present day is under 45% of the state population, and while that doesn’t 
change much by 2050 irrespective of the SSP, by 2100, the relative size of the city’s population to the state’s varies 
considerably. According to Zoraghein and O’Neill (2020b, p. 22) paraphrasing their results, SSP3 results in lower 
relative populations in suburban areas with higher population concentrated city centers; that is, SSP3 parameters 
result in population loss everywhere but more so outside the city. In contrast, suburban population growth is 
consistent with SSP5 and sprawling development – where the positive suburban population difference is limited to the 
surroundings of NYC, emphasizing NYC as the dominant socioeconomic hub of the state. “These effects are 
accentuated in 2100, where population decline under SSP3 is especially prominent … and in SSP5 the rapid 
suburban population growth around NYC is noticeable (…which in contrast to the suburbs, show lower populations 
than SSP2 in the city center).” Uncertainty is inherent in predicting the future: Given the post-World War II growth of 
NYC’s suburbs, as well as recent out-migration related to the COVID-19 pandemic and uptake in remote 
employment, it is necessary to envision a range of plausible futures such as those from SSP3 and SSP5 scenarios.

Adaptation (VIA) analysis. 
The different predicted changes are reflected in the proportion over age 65 and expected contributions of fertility, 
migration, and mortality across the three SSPs (Figure 5 for all NY State). SSP3 projects much higher proportions of 
those over 65 (and consequently much lower fertility and population totals) and lower proportions in SSP5 (shown 
Figure 5, panel C). Similarly, in terms of migration (based largely on historical patterns), New York States’s growth is 
due to the continued flows of international migration streams, rather than net internal migration; this largely accounts 
for the population decline seen in SSP3, even though that future also has low fertility and high mortality trends (Jiang 
et al., 2020). Note that net internal migration is negative in all three SSPs – that is, the state is assumed to lose 
internal migrants, on average – but only SSP3 has declining international migration, as well.

& Zoraghein, 2023) 
Differences in spatial distributions of the population are shown in Figure 6. There are many more low-density grid 
cells (shaded lighter hues) in SSP3 than in either SSP2 or especially SSP5. Population density increases in all 
boroughs in the SSP5 scenario, with increases in density especially notably in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, 
while falling in all areas in SSP3 (especially in Staten Island). The patterns to 2100 look quite similar to 2050. These 
maps are a first look at the spatial distribution of population but drawing on this application of the SSPs to the US, the 
approach of Jiang and colleagues (2020) and (Zoraghein & O’Neill, 2020a, 2020b) is being adapted to NYC, to 
include migration flows as well as inputs that are suitable to the diversity of NYC’s population as part of the ongoing 
VIA analysis. The VIA research will produce population projections for NYC that that go out to the end of the century

Built Futures 
NPCC3 inventoried multiple NYC critical infrastructure domains and infrastructure resilience strategies to address 
climate risks (Zimmerman et al., 2019). In this assessment, we consider other aspects of NYC’s built infrastructure 
that were not fully considered in NPCC3 but have become especially salient due to the recent crises of COVID-19 
and Hurricane Ida. We examine the role of buildings, especially residential structures, and their connection to the 
energy sector in NPCC4: Energy and Energy Insecurity, and below we consider surface transportation and, more 
broadly, the public right of way (ROW) to examine opportunities in the ROW for resilient NYC futures. In the case of 
the public ROW, it is an understudied topic and therefore our assessment concentrates on understanding its historical

Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New York City’s Futures 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
28 
and current features and the wide range of near and medium-term plans that address aspects of future planning 
processes. 
5.2.1 Historical transformations of New York City’s built environment 
NYC’s current built environment has been shaped over the past 200 years by urban design, economic transitions, 
population growth and migration, public health challenges, technological innovation that enabled infrastructure 
improvements, and interactions among these forces. Many changes involved transformation of heavily developed 
places to new uses. Some of these changes were adapted to the climate and other circumstances of the day but 
have become maladaptive over time. Others were harmful and/or inequitable when and as implemented. For 
example, in the early 1800s rapid population growth came before knowledge about communicable disease 
transmission and control, the construction of water and sanitation infrastructure, and adequate healthy housing 
resulted in overcrowded neighborhoods and recurrent lethal outbreaks from cholera, yellow fever, typhoid, and other 
infectious diseases. Notably, residents of basement apartments were observed to be at highest risk. Over time, 
communicable disease risks abated with the construction of the Croton reservoir, housing codes, and other public 
health measures (Plunz & Álvarez-Dávila, 2020). 
The early 20th century saw rapid, dense, transit-oriented development along new subway lines and the beginning of 
repurposing waterfront land from piers, warehouses, and industrial use to housing developments. While these 
publicly and privately financed developments were intended to provide decent affordable housing, they often 
reinforced de jure and de facto racial segregation (Rothstein, 2012). More recently, transit-oriented “upzoning” to 
develop underutilized waterfront and other neighborhoods has often resulted in luxury developments out of reach of 
households that could most benefit from transit access. Inequities in NYC-area land use policies is considered in 
more depth in NPCC4, Foster et al. (Foster et al., 2024). 
In the early and mid-20th century, bridge and highway construction afforded some NYC residents, those with cars, 
access to amenities (such as beaches and parks) outside the city. While the motivation behind parkway construction 
that excluded transit buses is disputed (Kessler, 2021), access was more difficult for those who could not afford cars. 
Over time, the same car-centric road building promoted suburban land development, including communities 
segregated by racially restrictive covenants (Sheidlower, 2020), brought traffic congestion caused by car commuters, 
and highways that bisected neighborhoods and afflicted them with air pollution and noise that impacts the city today. 
This history demonstrates the potential for built infrastructure, housing, and transportation systems to remake already 
developed land and the need for foresight and an equity lens to envision futures that avoid unhealthy and 
maladaptive pathways, as discussed further in the next section. 
5.2.2 Streets and the public right-of-way 
NPCC3 considered, as part of a broader look at resilience strategies for critical infrastructure, NYC’s rail public 
transportation and its surface transportation assets for moving vehicles and freight (Zimmerman et al., 2019). Plans 
and progress reports for addressing some of these risks are available (Metropolitan Transportation Authority Climate 
Adaptation Task Force, 2019). This section extends that assessment by focusing on the public right-of-way (ROW) – 
mainly streets and sidewalks – (Freudenberg et al., 2021) and how potential future uses can shape either greater 
resilience or greater vulnerability to climate risks. Realizing a more climate-adapted ROW would require prioritizing 
the most efficient, essential, accessible, safe, active, healthy, and sustainable transportation modes for moving 
people – bus transit, walking, and cycling – over the least efficient uses – parking and driving private motor vehicles 
(Figure 7. We have selected the ROW as a topic of interest because like other topics in this chapter, it requires 
substantial interdisciplinarity drawing on concepts from multiple sectors to be brought to bear.

Figure 7: The Capacity of a Single 10-Foot Lane (or equivalent width) by Mode at Peak Conditions with Normal Operations (National 
Association of City Transportation Officials, 2016) 
The urgent need and possibility of much faster and more ambitious repurposing of the ROW was made clear by the 
recent climate and health crises of flooding from Hurricane Ida (City of New York Office of the Deputy Mayor for 
Administration, 2021) and the urgent need for safe outdoor spaces for socially distanced gathering, dining, and 
exercising created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In a densely developed city like New York, the ROW is a critical asset, comprising approximately 16.5% of the land 
area of the city (32,000 of 193,700 acres) (Freudenberg et al., 2021) that can be used in ways that are either adaptive 
and equitable or in ways that are maladaptive and inequitable. Past decisions, beginning a century ago, have shaped 
the ROW in maladaptive ways to prioritize the movement and parking of private motor vehicles; according to one 
estimate, NYC devotes enough curb space to park 3 million vehicles (Czebotar, 2021; Freudenberg et al., 2021). 
Now there is abundant evidence of how built and natural features in the public ROW influence climate risks and how 
the future of NYC’s ROWs can be shaped to reduce climate risks from heat, flooding, and air pollution while providing 
co-benefits of improved health, greater equity, sustainability, and economic development. Several existing NYC 
policies, investments, and plans are already beginning to shape a more climate adapted ROW. Other more ambitious 
plans have been proposed and are supported by successful transformations of other global cities. 
Asphalt contributes to climate risks from hot weather and flooding. When exposed to sun, asphalt is a major 
contributor to the urban heat island (Mohajerani et al., 2017) and higher surface temperatures in turn increase the 
vulnerability to illness and death during hot weather in NYC (Madrigano et al., 2015). Asphalt and other impervious 
surfaces in the ROW speed the movement of stormwater as it seeks low points, increasing the risk of dangerous 
flash flooding for residents of basement apartments, subway users, and even drivers. For a detailed discussion of 
pluvial flooding, see NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al ( B. Rosenzweig et al., 2024). Reducing the amount of ROW devoted 
to impervious asphalt and replacing it with trees, vegetated bioswales, and materials that are less heat absorbing and 
more pervious can reduce both risks. 
Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), including PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), exacerbates multiple chronic health 
conditions, contributes to preventable morbidity and mortality (Bosson et al., 2019; Khreis et al., 2017; Yang et al., 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New York City’s Futures 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
30 
2018). In NYC, TRAP disproportionately impacts communities with higher populations of people who are low-income, 
Black or Hispanic, and living in places disproportionately impacted by emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles 
(Kheirbek et al., 2016a). Concentrations of TRAP, of which ambient NO2 is a useful indicator, is highest close to busy 
roadways and declines rapidly with distance (Brugge et al., 2015). Exposures to TRAP in cities can be greatly 
reduced by limiting traffic on streets with large numbers of pedestrians and cyclists or by creating low-emission zones 
in densely populated areas. (Aaron, 2011; Brugge et al., 2015; Pestel & Wozny, 2019; Zhai & Wolff, 2021). 
Because NYC’s public right of ways are vital conduits for movement of people and goods, freeing space for climate 
adapted uses requires prioritizing transportation modes that make the most of available street space. Dedicated 
busways, bus lanes, sidewalks and pedestrian plazas can move roughly 5-6 times more people per hour than a lane 
devoted to moving private motor vehicles (Figure 7). Parking private motor vehicles occupies valuable space in curb 
lanes, while enabling the movement of relatively few people. The present allocation of space to private motor vehicles 
is one reason why traffic congestion has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels (Hinsdale, 2022). Progress reducing 
traffic deaths has stalled (City of New York, 2013), bus speeds remain slow (Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
2023) and ridership fell in each of the several years prior to the pandemic (Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
2020), while NYC GHG emissions from transportation were little changed from 2010 through 2019, the last pre-
pandemic year for which data is available (City of New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 
2022b). 
In addition to freeing ROW space to help cool it, manage stormwater, and provide cleaner air, prioritizing efficient 
transportation modes would provide multiple health co-benefits (Figure 8). Regular trips using transit, walking, 
cycling, or combinations of these increase physical activity that provides multiple physical and mental health benefits 
(Besser & Dannenberg, 2005a; Edwards, 2008a; Gaesser & Angadi, 2021; Heath et al., 2012a; Saint-Maurice et al., 
2022; The Community Guide, 2017), helping to shape a future population with a lower burden of health conditions 
that make people more vulnerable to heat, flooding, and power outages (see NPCC4, Matte et al. (Matte et al., 
2024)). Narrower and fewer traffic lanes help calm and slow traffic, reducing injury and death risk of vehicle collisions 
with pedestrians and cyclists (Lubbe et al., 2022; Smart Growth America, 2022). Dedicated safe space for 
pedestrians and cyclists could also help support safe routes to school programs for children, with proven health 
benefits (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023; Muennig et al., 2014; Stewart et al., 2014). Finally, 
busways and bus lanes to speed trips and increase ridership will provide a greater return of passenger service for the 
existing transit bus fleet. Expansion of the battery electric bus service will help reduce TRAP, and it can be facilitated 
by reducing range losses from congestion and the energy needed for winter heating (Sustainable Bus, 2022; Zhou et 
al., 2016). In addition to these transportation-related health benefits, increasing greenery that people will encounter 
every day in the ROW has multiple positive effects on mental and physical health (Keeler et al., 2019). The potential 
health and environmental benefits of natural features in urban communities is an area of active research.  
Other important climate, equity, and development benefits can flow from a re-envisioned ROW in NYC. These include 
improved access to jobs and services, curbside space to scale up composting and reduce GHG emissions from solid 
waste management as well as the improvement of waste staging in NYC (see Clean Curbs (City of New York 
Department of Sanitation, 2016)), reducing combined-sewer overflows (CSO) and non-point stormwater pollution 
(City of New York Department of Environmental Protection, 2023a), and expanding space for economic, social, 
recreational, and cultural activity (Freudenberg et al., 2021). 
The spatial and temporal scale of changes to the ROW vary from very local and rapid (e.g., street closures and 
repurposed space during the COVID pandemic) to medium term, such as bus lanes that require community 
consultation but minimal new construction, to longer term such as removing an urban highway. What history and 
other cities have made clear is that some rapid near-term change is possible, but that forward-looking, multi-sectoral 
planning is needed to avoid lock-in of maladaptive uses and enable future transformations. 
Several city policies, investments, and plans are already beginning to transform the public right-of-way for climate 
adaptation. These include: NYC Streets Plan, Green Wave cycling plan, Better Buses Action Plan, NYC Plaza 
Program, Open Streets, and Pedestrian Mobility Plan (City of New York, 2019; City of New York Department of 
Transportation, 2023c, 2023b, 2023a). A reimagined public right of way can also support broader visions and goals 
for NYC’s post pandemic future, such as those in Making New York Work for Everyone: reimagining business 
districts, making it easier to get to work, and generating inclusive, future focused growth (NYCEDC, 2022). 
Successful implementations of these approaches in NYC include the 14th Street busway, which improved bus speeds 
and ridership, reduced traffic crashes and pedestrian injuries, and increased Citi Bike use (City of New York 
Department of Transportation, 2022; Sam Swartz, 2019) and the pedestrian plaza that revitalized Times Square while 
reducing exposure to traffic pollution (Aaron, 2011). Other global cities have implemented approaches that could be 
adapted to the varied local contexts of NYC neighborhoods, such as Barcelona’s superblock initiative that limits, 
shares, or closes some neighborhood streets to through traffic to enhance pedestrian, retail, and commercial activity.

This and other strategies for transforming and capturing greater benefits from the public right of way in NYC have 
been proposed (Freudenberg et al., 2021; Transportation Alternatives, 2021).

5.3 
Health Futures 
Shaping an urban environment that supports human health and wellbeing, as well as social and economic opportunity 
and equity should be a central aim of the City’s climate planning (Capon, 2017). Pathways to achieve this aim can be 
informed by methods and tools that quantitatively and qualitatively assess local health impacts, both beneficial and 
harmful, and their distribution under different policy alternatives and future scenarios (Castillo et al., 2021; Foster et 
al., 2019; Sohn et al., 2018). Health impacts may be considered “co-benefits” (or co-harms) when other sectors are 
the primary goal or focus of a policy or planning scenario, such as climate change mitigation, transportation 
improvements, or ecosystem conservation. Alternatively, policies that primarily have public health and welfare goals 
can have co-benefits of enhancing climate change adaptation and resilience. Health co-benefits of reallocating space 
in the public right-of-way are discussed in the preceding section. Other examples of health co-benefits of climate 
action, and tools to assessment, follow. 
5.3.1 Health impact assessment and co-benefits: greenhouse gas mitigation, air 
pollution, and active mobility  
Reducing local air pollution emissions and concentrations provides important health co-benefits from reducing local 
greenhouse gas emissions. Measures of air pollution can be estimated using the US EPA’s Benefits Mapping and 
Analysis Program Community Edition (BenMAP) tool (Sacks et al., 2018) in conjunction with local and regional air 
pollution emissions and atmospheric modeling. For example, fully implementing NYC’s 2014 strategy of reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% by 2050, was estimated to annually avoid between 160 and 390 premature 
deaths, relative to a 2012-2014 annual average, and health-related costs valued at $3.4 billion (Johnson et al., 2020). 
Similar methods can also be used to estimate potential health co-benefits of sector-specific actions, such as phasing 
out the most polluting heating fuels either prospectively or retrospectively using ambient monitoring data (Kheirbek et 
al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). Clean air scenarios can also be evaluated to estimate health benefits of idealized, 
hypothetical futures, such as sustaining air pollution improvements observed during COVID-19 restrictions or 
eliminating traffic related PM2.5 emissions. By analyzing both air quality change and health data at neighborhood 
scale, these analyses also show that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities are most harmed by 
current emission levels and their spatial distribution and have the most to gain from cleaner air (Figure 9) (Johnson et 
al., 2020; Kheirbek et al., 2014, 2016b; Perera et al., 2021).

neighborhood poverty. Adapted from Johnson et al., Figure 3  (Johnson et al., 2020). 
Health impact assessment is a tool that can engage community stakeholders in ways that enhance procedural equity 
and shed light on distributive equity of proposed actions (Foster et al., 2019; Sohn et al., 2018). Often overlooked in 
health impact assessments focused on clean air benefits of climate action are the health benefits that transportation, 
land use, and urban planning strategies can provide through shifting from driving to more active modes of getting 
around such as walking and cycling (Mueller et al., 2015). Benefits of regular physical activity during trips to access 
jobs, school, services, and other essential needs include improved self-reported health, greater fitness, weight loss or 
less weight gain, reduced risk of chronic physical and mental health conditions, and reduced death rates (Gaesser & 
Angadi, 2021; Heath et al., 2012b; Saint-Maurice et al., 2022; The Community Guide, 2017, 2023). Active mobility 
need not involve cycling or walking alone; transit trips almost always involve physical activity beneficial to health, like 
walking (Besser & Dannenberg, 2005b; Edwards, 2008b) or cycling (Dutch Cycling Embassy (DCE), 2023; Nello-
Deakin & Brömmelstroet, 2021) to and from stations and stops, with a shared motorized segment in the middle. 
Physical activity benefits of shifting trips from driving to transit and other active modes can provide health benefits far 
surpassing those from strategies focused on air quality improvements alone, such as electrifying cars to reduce 
tailpipe emissions. While health benefit pathways depend on local context, this importance of physical activity 
benefits has been shown in health impact assessments conducted in the Northeast, (Harvard T.H. Chan School of 
Public Health, 2021; James et al., 2014) in London, and Delhi (Woodcock et al., 2009). 
NYC has long had many walkable neighborhoods (City of New York Department of Environmental Health, 2023) and 
has expanded its cycling infrastructure (City of New York Department of Transportation, 2019). However, faster, more 
comprehensive implementation of safe street designs is needed to reduce fatal pedestrian and cyclist crashes (New 
York Police Department, 2023) and to make adjustments in shared walkways and bike paths for an increasingly older 
population. Reducing private vehicle trips in favor of transit, cycling, and walking could also make more efficient use 
of the public right-of-way to move people, (Global Designing Cities Initiative, 2016, p. 14) freeing up space for 
additional trees, bioswales, and other green infrastructure, reducing local urban heat island effects, and better 
managing stormwater runoff, all of which may make investments in ROW even more compelling.  
5.3.2 Heat, mechanical cooling, and health: applying maladaptation criteria to the local 
context 
In NYC during the latter part of the 20th century, there was a substantial decline in excess mortality associated with 
higher temperature during the warm season (Petkova et al., 2014). This trend occurred nationally in association with 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New York City’s Futures 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
33 
increasing access to residential air conditioning (Barreca et al., 2013). Globally increased air conditioning prevalence 
from 1972-2009 was associated with reduced heat-related mortality in a comparison among several high-income 
countries, but the findings suggest that other adaptive strategies such as investments in green infrastructure and 
social connectedness may have played a more important role (Sera et al., 2020).  
Without air conditioning, indoor temperatures can be much higher than outdoors, a difference that persists for up to 3 
days after the temperatures have cooled off outside (Vant-Hull et al., 2018) due to thermal inertia of the building, 
highlighting the importance of understanding the interplay of the built and demographic character of cities. This may 
play a role in the delayed effects of up to 3 days documented in studies of NYC heat-exacerbated deaths (Matte et 
al., 2016; Metzger et al., 2010). Elevated indoor temperatures may also play a role in deaths and illnesses that occur 
when the outdoor temperature is moderately hot but not extreme (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2022a). Those who die of heat stress in NYC are most often overcome by heat in dangerously hot homes 
without a working air conditioner (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022a, 2022d). 
Vulnerable New Yorkers most often stay at home during hot weather, even if unable to stay cool because of a lack of 
air conditioning (Lane et al., 2014). Other health benefits of mechanical cooling are discussed in NPCC4, Matte et 
al.,(2024). 
Air conditioning already accounts for a substantial share of residential and commercial energy use in the US (17%, 
12%) (Biardeau et al., 2020). By contrast, among energy uses in NYC’s multifamily buildings, space cooling 
accounted for just 4% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 compared to 15% in commercial buildings. Across all 
NYC buildings, energy consumption for space heating (42%) and domestic hot water (15%) accounted for more GHG 
emissions that space cooling (8%) (City of New York, 2016). The need for heating and cooling will likely shift with 
increased climate impacts requiring increased cooling (and likely decreased heating) as well driven by population and 
demographic change. Air conditioning use increases peak electric demand during hot weather, and potentially 
outages, which are associated with health risks. The NPCC3 noted the potential for heat waves to severely stress the 
electric grid (Zimmerman et al., 2019). As recently as June 2021, it was reported that the major electricity outage 
threat during a heat wave was narrowly averted, but many neighborhoods were affected by localized outages and 
voltage reductions (Noor, 2021). Waste heat from building air conditioning may contribute substantially to the urban 
heat island, especially in dense cities (Gamarro et al., 2020; Ohashi et al., 2007) potentially adding to the risk of 
outages. More information on the health risks of power outages is provided in NPCC4, Yoon et al.(2024). 
Substantial lock-in risks and vulnerabilities that accompanied the health benefits of mechanical cooling have already 
occurred over several decades in NYC, but the benefits and risks are inequitably distributed. Nearly all commercial 
and institutional buildings are mechanically cooled and roughly 90% of households have at least one air conditioner, 
but the proportions without access vary more than four-fold across neighborhoods. Households in low-income 
communities, and non-Hispanic Black people are more likely to lack air conditioning or report being unable to pay the 
added electricity cost (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022c; Lane et al., 2014; 
Madrigano et al., 2018). In a warming climate, the increased energy cost burden will fall hardest on these populations 
(City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022b; Ortiz et al., 2022). The health and equity effects 
of energy cost burden and insecurity are addressed in more detail in NPCC4, Yoon et al. (Yoon et al., 2024). 
Mechanical cooling in many large NYC buildings has been accompanied by maladaptive building design changes. 
During a warm weather power outage, glass façade high-rise buildings gain heat faster than comparable brick 
buildings (Urban Green Council, 2014). Limited operable window area and potential for passive ventilation may lock 
in the need for more mechanical cooling. Even when opening windows can maintain thermal comfort, a lack of 
screens in many modern buildings provides access for mosquitos that can transmit diseases like West Nile virus (see 
Section 3.5 in NPCC4, Matte et al.) (Matte et al., 2024). Raising air conditioning set points to avoid wasteful over-
cooling while maintaining safe indoor temperatures can substantially reduce cooling energy use (Ortiz et al., 2022). 
Other co-benefits (or costs) can be considered in building design. For example, energy efficient building design can 
also be bird-friendly design because increased glass on building facades increases both heating and cooling energy 
requirements and fatal bird strikes (Klem et al., 2009; Morris & Barges, 2023; Sheppard & Phillips, 2015). With Local 
law 15 (Local Law 15, 2020), NYC is already a leader in this space requiring new construction, and significantly 
altered buildings to use bird-friendly materials. Additionally, shade trees, green roofs, and other nature-based 
features can provide cooling through shading and evapotranspiration serving as key sources of heat adaptation 
through cooling that has potential to support reduced health-related impacts of heat exposure (Crown et al., 2023), 
and thus reduce the need for potentially maladaptive responses in the short-term. 
5.4 
Nature and Nature-based Futures 
NYC is a complex social-ecological-technological system in which the ecological dimension is a fundamental driver of 
human health and well-being and a critical component of climate adaptation and mitigation strategies (Keeler et al., 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New York City’s Futures 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
34 
2019; R. McDonald & Beatley, 2021; R. I. McDonald et al., 2023; McPhearson et al., 2022b). Nature and nature-
based solutions have potential to provide many climate adaptation services in cities (stormwater management, urban 
heat island relief, flood, and erosion protection) and simultaneously provide health, social, economic, and ecological 
co-benefits that improve the well-being of people and support biodiversity and the function of ecosystems. In this 
section, we provide a brief assessment of how nature and nature-based solutions can contribute to a healthier, more 
resilient, equitable, and sustainable future for NYC. 
As NYC prepares for increased climate change impacts, nature and nature-based solutions (NBS) can play an 
important role in addressing the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, connecting people to nature 
where they live, and increasing the resilience of both people and nature. The International Union for Conservation of 
Nature (IUCN) defines NBS as “actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems 
that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and 
biodiversity benefits” (IUCN, 2020). NBS encompasses both natural ecosystems and engineered solutions that 
incorporate or mimic characteristics of nature to achieve the services needed by the city. Cities around the world are 
using NBS in innovative ways to address some of urban planning’s biggest challenges (Keeler et al., 2019). One 
advantage to NBS over traditional engineered solutions is that they can be multi-disciplinary efforts designed to 
address more than just one issue and create feedbacks among urban social, ecological, and technological systems 
providing multiple co-benefits (McPhearson et al., 2023; Treglia et al., 2022). Because urban NBS exist in a 
developed urban area where the natural processes on which they depend have been disrupted, natural areas require 
strategic long-term management to maintain desired benefits for people and ecosystem function (Pregitzer et al., 
2018; Swadek et al., 2021) and engineered NBS require a dedicated workforce trained to design, install, and maintain 
them (Just Nature NYC, 2021). 
Natural habitats (forests, wetlands, grasslands, streams) within NYC have intrinsic value, provide valuable ecosystem 
services that benefit people, and support local, regional, and global biodiversity (Cullman et al., 2023). Nature-based 
solutions of the engineered variety are diverse and can include parks and other green spaces, street trees, green 
roofs, community gardens, living shorelines, rain gardens, and bioswales. In addition to the measurable benefits of 
heat reduction, stormwater management, and carbon sequestration provided by green and blue infrastructure in the 
city, some of the most important services provided by nature are those that support human health and well-being that 
cannot be replicated by engineered solutions (e.g. Keeler et al., 2019). Streets and ROWs that are shaded by dense 
tree canopy create opportunities for active mobility and recreation. Engagement in urban environmental stewardship 
such as tending to green spaces like building a bioswale or working in a community garden can build community 
identity and social resilience (Campbell, Svendsen, et al., 2021; McMillen et al., 2019). 
While the utility and efficiency of NBS for climate adaptation and social and ecological co-benefits has been widely 
documented (Bridges et al., 2015, 2018; IUCN, 2020), operationalizing them to achieve holistic resilience benefits in 
an equitable way is still a developing practice (Andersson et al., 2021; Wickenberg et al., 2021; Wijsman et al., 2021). 
Meeting our current challenges will require planning where and how to implement these strategies in a complex city 
system (Hoover et al., 2023; McPhearson et al., 2022a). Inclusive engagement of communities who will experience 
the benefits and burdens of decisions highlights their values and explicitly centers equity and justice to avoid 
unintended consequences that could exacerbate inequity (Grabowski et al., 2023). 
One example of an ongoing effort to address NYC’s needs for equitable application of NBS is the Forest for All NYC 
coalition working to advance the Urban Forest Agenda (NYC Urban Forest Task Force, 2021). The coalition is 
composed of over 126 diverse organizations including environmental justice and community groups, City agencies, 
NGOs and other groups working to support and equitably expand the urban forest to benefit all New Yorkers. 
Coalition goals include equitably expanding tree canopy cover citywide to 30% by 2035, advocating authentic 
engagement with local communities, and elevating local needs and leadership. Equitable expansion of NBS in NYC 
has tremendous potential to transform the function of NYC systems and the well-being of its inhabitants. Just as it 
takes time for a newly planted tree to expand its canopy and provide heat-reducing shade, authentic community 
engagement to identify the right solution for the right place takes time. Investment in solutions that integrate social, 
ecological, and economic attributes will be instrumental in transitioning NYC into a more healthy, resilient, 
sustainable, and equitable city. 
5.5 
Benefit-Cost Analysis 
Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is a planning tool used by federal, state, and local governments, including NYC (City of 
New York Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, 2022a), to evaluate whether a proposed policy, project, 
or regulation should be pursued. The deciding criterion is whether benefits are greater than costs. The big question in 
applying BCA in practice, especially with an eye toward equity considerations: benefits and costs for whom? This 
question must be considered across generations, with discount rate assumptions front and center, as well as equity 
considerations within generations. Key in the application of BCA is for all assumptions to be fully transparent. BOX 4 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New York City’s Futures 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
35 
lays out a set of best practices and guidance for applying BCA to climate mitigation and adaptation projects (for 
related discussions, see NPCC4, Foster et al. (Foster et al., 2024) and NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al. (B. Rosenzweig et 
al., 2024)). 
Challenges to monetizing benefits and costs in applying BCAs have led to the development of many other alternative 
decision mechanisms, including ‘multi-criteria analysis’, ‘robust decision making’, ‘socially tolerable risk’, ‘maxi-min’ to 
maximize the lot of those worst off, ‘mini-max’ to minimize the maximum downside risk, and related methods. Multi-
criteria analysis, for example, is just that, adding criteria other than maximizing (monetized and monetizable) net 
benefits as decision tools. ‘Robust decision making’ comes close to recommendation #1 in BOX 4 below: focus on 
risks and uncertainties, in a BCA framework. While some of these analyses, like those focusing on ‘fat tails’ and 
extreme risks (i.e., predicting the probability of extreme outcomes and being “fatter” making those outcomes more 
likely), pose fundamental challenges to standard BCA analysis. Strictly speaking, fat-tailed distributions make BCAs 
literally impossible (Weitzman, 2009) yet no other decision criterion comes close to the overall rigor and internal 
consistency of BCAs when properly applied. One downside is that unquantified and perhaps even unquantifiable risks 
and uncertainties might indeed dominate, which requires developing proper frameworks to deal with true ‘unknown 
unknowns’. Practically, it might mean treating the outcome of a BCA as the ‘lower bound’ of large potential range of 
outcomes.

BOX 4: BCA guidance and best practices. 
Be explicit about risks, uncertainties, and biases 
BCA, in the broadest sense, is merely an attempt to compare like with like, typically by translating benefits and costs of any (policy) 
action — or the lack thereof — into dollars and cents. Therein begin the problems: calculating ‘cents’ would immediately imply false 
precision, false accuracy, or worse — leading to a fundamental confusion of precision with rationality (Brookes & Wagner, 2021). 
Users of this tool must be careful not to fall into that trap. 
 
Every BCA is biased. The question is which way these biases go. For individual public works projects such as local adaptation 
measures, benefits are sometimes overestimated while costs are often underestimated. The latter is due to the inherent delays and 
cost overruns. For example, costs are based on third-party bids, which are incentivized to lower their costs. Delays, inflation, 
additional regulatory burdens, and other reasons, meanwhile, lead to increased costs. Adaptation benefits, too, might be 
underestimated largely due to missing quantifications of ‘indirect’ benefits. Underestimates of both benefits and costs now leads to 
the need to trading off the relative biases, a task made more difficult because even the signs of biases might change with the type 
of projects analyzed (Flyvbjerg & Bester, 2021). 
 
For climate mitigation BCAs, the biases often go the other way — with costs of cutting emissions often overestimated (sometimes, 
substantially so) while societal benefits are underestimated. The latter is largely due to difficulties and delays in quantifying 
expected climate benefits and other risks and uncertainties. The former might be even more important: Biased cost estimates are 
due to the rapid nature of technological change and improvements in mitigation technologies and processes. The overall result is a 
bias toward inaction (Wagner et al., 2021). 
 
Any BCA tools developed need to allow for presenting risks, uncertainties, and biases — at the very least by presenting ‘high’ and 
‘low’ estimates in addition to ‘best’/’average’ results. Ideally, BCAs would span full-fledged uncertainty analysis, relying on 
probability density functions rather than point estimates. That process, too, might introduce false precision by forcing guesstimates 
of uncertainty ranges that are unmeasurable. Sometimes then, these biases necessitate moving (well) beyond BCA as a decision-
tool. When examining risks and uncertainties, and the appropriate step could be to look toward direct ‘risk-risk tradeoffs’ 
(Zeckhauser & Wagner, 2019) a BCA emphasizing the probability of extreme impact risks (sometimes called tail risk). 
 
Efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and equity 
One danger of applying BCAs is elevating narrow interpretations of (economic) efficiency above all else, including important 
distributional considerations. That would be a mistake and misapplication of the concept — and also presents an important 
stumbling block in socializing and getting broader buy-in for BCAs. A SETS approach could also benefit BCA. Though BCA do well 
in terms of  efficacy and cost-effectiveness, they could more explicitly include equity and co-benefits (such as in health and nature 
outcomes) as part of the BCA calculations.  
 
A first step to avoid this fallacy is to explicitly split efficiency into efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and to add equity as an explicit 
additional criterion, at least in any narrative describing the analysis. Enlightened BCAs can span all three, with ‘equity weights’ 
explicitly incorporating effects of inequality (Anthoff et al., 2009). City-level applications might pose additional challenges, but that 
does not excuse their absence in BCAs. If anything, it calls for a shared understanding of the need to incorporating equity 
considerations into BCAs and standardized approaches across city agencies to do so. 
 
Applying equity weights and putting distributional impacts front and center are important in lending BCAs much-needed legitimacy. 
Case in point is the U.S. Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, which ended in U.S. government 
agencies agreeing to disagree, and for U.S. EPA to go it alone with its own SCC (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022). 
The separation of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, meanwhile, might be less important in the final analysis. BCA clearly spans both. 
 
Train, engage NYC agency staff to help conduct BCA analyses 
Some agencies like DOT already conduct their own BCAs. Other agencies outsource theirs. Since many agencies are now 
considering how to mitigate and especially adapt to climate change, thus establishing capacity and consistency across agencies’ 
effort may be an important city-wide objective. BCAs, and the framing they provide, could be one important parts of this process.

6 Limitations of Future Scenarios and Approaches 
Despite the variety of scenarios and current approaches for envisioning the future of NYC and its many transitions, 
they also have recognized limitations. Among these limitations are shortcomings in the degree of understanding 
about who and where future New Yorkers will be living and working; lack of a longer-term perspective on lessons 
from relevant policies in the recent past with place-based implications; lack of comprehensive comparisons between 
approaches; and the need to consider these projected futures in an integrated way across the multiple sectors and 
dimensions of NYC’s urban systems. While it is a sizeable challenge to describe integrated, multi-sectoral, plausible 
pathways to positive futures for NYC, providing details of how future events might unfold can limit anxiety toward 
worrisome future events and reduce the perceived likelihood of negative outcomes (Jing et al., 2016). 
Discussing uncertainty allows us to better understand the range and parameters around different futures. Low 
probability events (such as catastrophic flood expected to occur once in a 1000 years) with high magnitude and 
potential for damage cannot be predicted but can be projected recognizing that such projections come with high 
uncertainty due to the low probability nature of such events. Another challenge inherent in projecting or envisioning 
the future is that it may include events or disturbances that we have yet to experience, or even imagine. The COVID-
19 pandemic and Hurricane Ida (in which the City for the first time issued a flash flood warning), are other examples 
of events that in the past many planners would have considered unlikely, but nonetheless have now occurred. Lastly, 
unforeseen and unintended consequences of plans add another layer to uncertainty and while the magnitude of such 
consequences can often not be forecasted, narratives around such consequences can often be articulated. 
6.1 
Climate Actions and Plans Can Be Adaptive or Maladaptive 
Plans and actions to enable resilient futures can be adaptive or maladaptive. Maladaptation describes actions that 
lead to increased vulnerability or risk to climate impacts or diminish welfare. The IPCC describes responses to 
climate change that unintentionally “create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and expensive 
to change and exacerbate existing inequalities” as maladaptive. Understanding the processes leading to 
maladaptation can help prevent it. Whether an action is maladapted or not can depend on social or environmental 
context, scale, or time. In some cases, maladaptive responses to hazards have exacerbated inequality in the 
distribution of impacts, for example shifting risk from one community or group to another. 
There are a variety of causes of maladaptation, including lack of knowledge. For example, early in the 20th Century, 
health officials recommended substituting the new automobile technologies to replace horses. Horses created 
excrement and often died on city streets, creating safety and health hazards. Health officials argued the automobiles 
were a good, healthy solution to urban horse use (McShane, 1994; Melosi, 2000; Tarr, 1971), only to see rising 
injuries, deaths, traffic congestion, and other problems caused by the flooding of cars into cities. Similarly, unintended 
consequences of segregated land use zoning, which was originally put forth to keep residents away from industrial 
locations, included it becoming a tool for creating segregated suburban communities (Jackson, 1985). Alternatively, 
maladaptation can also occur through plans, policies, or investments that consider sectors and climate risks in 
isolation or that ignore climate risks for what are seen as more urgent planning priorities. In the local context, this has 
involved, for example, policies that subsidize and encourage driving, parking, and car ownership, removing electric 
streetcars, widening surface streets and building urban highways without considering implications for health, safety 
and equity and, more recently climate risks, equity, and mitigation goals. Maladaptation can also result if climate risks 
are not considered in “non-climate” policies that influence climate risks, such as those governing zoning, building 
codes, and affordable housing. 
For example, building walls to keep floodwaters out of low-lying areas can be a critical source of coastal flood 
protection but may also be maladaptive over longer time frames because sea walls can give a false sense of security, 
encourage additional development in flood-prone areas, limit public access to the water, exacerbate erosion, 
negatively impact coastal habitats, and may be built to design guidelines that become quickly outdated as sea level 
rise and storm surge projections change over time (Dodman et al., 2022). Structural mitigations like floodwalls can 
also result in “resilience gentrification” resulting in greater inequality (Gould & Lewis, 2021). Floodwalls and tide gates 
are generally designed for a single purpose, and as such, may fail to meet the complex needs of a city. Indeed, 
NYC’s flood reduction strategy must address multiple compound flood hazards including storm surge, regular tidal 
flooding, groundwater flooding, heavy rainfall and compound flooding (see NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al.(B. Rosenzweig 
et al., 2024)), but it must also balance flood protection with other resiliency needs such as sustainable economic 
development, social equity and affordable housing, and biodiversity and the protection of nature that together will 
support resilience of the city long term. 
Several evidence-informed criteria can be applied to assess whether actions are adaptive or maladaptive within the 
local context of NYC and its diverse communities. One example, the use and expansion of mechanical cooling in 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment 
Concepts and Tools for Envisioning New York City’s Futures 
 
 Interim Report for Public Release 
38 
several types of NYC buildings, was considered in Section 5.3.2 . Elsewhere in this assessment, measures are 
described to reverse or reduce maladaptation in other sectors, including the public right of way, mechanical cooling in 
buildings, and flood protection. For most adaptation strategies, recognizing inherent feedbacks among system 
components (such as between use of air conditioning to reduce heat risks that may also increase energy use and 
increase carbon emissions) will be critical to ensure intended adaptation approaches do not become or enhance 
maladaptation in other systems, contexts, or timescales. Similarly, trade-offs are likely to exist for all adaptation 
strategies, including spatial trade-offs such as where adaptation in one location may increase and thus drive 
maladaptation in other locations. Whether maladaptation occurs thus depends on whether a particular strategy or 
climate adaptation action is examined for larger potential trade-offs, cross-sector impacts, and longer-term effects 
versus short-term outcomes. 
6.2 
Uncertainty 
There are many uncertainties that must be accounted for in estimating and planning for the future. Like weather 
forecasts, these include temporal and spatial factors and pertain to the social and ecological themes as well as 
climate-related factors: It is more difficult to predict the future, the farther one goes, and predicting changes that will 
occur in precise locations (specific neighborhoods) is much less certain than in larger spatial units (all of NYC, or the 
greater metropolitan area). The IPCC has been a leader in thinking about ways to address uncertainty in the future 
climate, examples from which are shown in BOX 5. 
In addition to understanding climate futures, each sector, and within those particular themes (or variables of interest), 
produces models that generate futures that quantify or qualify uncertainty in different ways. Typically, there are trade-
offs between spatial and temporal uncertainty, which make futuring exercises at a long-term sub-city scale 
challenging. Furthermore, models used to predict the future have their own uncertainty associated with the data and 
estimation techniques. While we have identified many of these areas of uncertainty in this chapter, future work on 
understanding and communicating uncertainty inherent in city scale issues remains to be done.

BOX 5: How the IPCC contextualizes uncertainty 
“Impacts at high levels of warming are particularly uncertain, as all methodologies require extrapolation and insufficiently 
incorporate possible tipping elements in the climate system (from IPCC WGII Ch.16 (O’Neill et al., 2022)).  
“Unlike known or identified risks, emergent risks are characterized by the uncertainty of consequences and/or probabilities of 
occurrence. The International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) suggests three categories of emergent risks: (1) high uncertainty 
and a lack of knowledge about potential impacts and interactions with risk-absorbing systems; (2) increasing complexity, emergent 
interactions and systemic dependencies that can lead to nonlinear impacts and surprises; and (3) changes in context (for example, 
social and behavioural trends, organizational settings, regulations, natural environments) that may alter the nature, probability and 
magnitude of expected impacts.” (O’Neill et al., 2022).

the limits to adaptation. Chapters identified here refer to IPCC6, WGII. Source: O’Neill et al., (2022, p. 2419) 
The challenges of managing these risks are amplified by the complex interactions between climate and urban scenarios, owing to 
the smaller spatial–temporal scales of urban areas in climate change modelling relative to global climate models (GCM) and shared 
socioeconomic pathways (SSP); geographical or geomorphological variations in city location; uncertainties arising from incomplete 
assumptions about socio-economic pathways at urban scales affecting demographic characteristics of cities, etc.

7 Sustained Engagement Through New York City Climate 
Knowledge Exchange 
Sustained engagement is a foundational component of sustained assessment and may contribute to building 
communities of practice and establishing a public agenda for climate research. Through the sharing of knowledge 
about ongoing efforts across the City, sustained engagement with city government agencies, community groups, 
academics, and others can help to foster informed decision-making, build community capacity and empowerment, 
and inform the development of effective communications tools. Sustained engagement helps to identify current gaps 
in knowledge and practices and create a process for discourse and knowledge sharing about how to effectively plan 
for adaptation in the short and medium term. 
In 2020, the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ) initiated the Climate Knowledge 
Exchange (CKE), a sustained engagement process to identify the City’s climate research priorities and co-produce a 
future public climate research agenda for the City. In Year 1, the CKE brought together over 170 participants from city 
agencies and NGOs in small discussion groups. Using a combination of thematic analysis from the discussions, 
document review of existing community based and government plans and analysis of survey data, MOCEJ developed 
an agenda for future climate resiliency and adaptation research: 1) Living with Climate Change, 2) Managing 
Resiliency, 3) Climate and the Built Environment, and 4) Climate Communication, Education, and Engagement. For 
more details on each research priority, see the State of Climate Knowledge 2021 Report (City of New York, 2022). 
Participants also identified future areas of improvement for the climate knowledge exchange process, including create 
sustained partnerships and build awareness of ongoing efforts, raise funding to support community participation in 
research initiatives, improve information sharing and knowledge development, recognize multiple ways of knowing, 
and evaluate outcomes of the CKE process and research. 
These improvement areas helped to inform Year 2 of the CKE, which took a step back from Year 1 to refine the 
design of the engagement process to achieve the CKE’s broader objectives using the Theory of Change (TOC) 
framework. A TOC is a tool for planning, implementing, and evaluating an initiative, and typically includes a statement 
of the problem being addressed, an overarching end goal, and short, medium, and long-term pathways to achieve the 
end goal. Through a series of three workshops in 2022, participants co-produced a TOC for the CKE. The five key 
goals identified, and informed by Year 1 improvement areas, were: Sustained funding is achieved; information is 
accessible to all; networking and partnerships with stakeholders are created and maintained; multi-way exchanges to 
empower and elevate communities are established; and Brave spaces for listening and learning are fostered. A full 
description of the workshops and outcomes is available in the State of Climate Knowledge Exchange 2022 Workshop 
Summary Report (City of New York, 2022). 
The city continues the CKE, currently in Year 3, as a forum for sharing information, research, and initiatives amongst 
a diverse group of city and state agencies, community organizations, nonprofits, and academic institutions. The CKE 
is one model of sustained engagement processes, and going forward, others may also be adopted. 
8 Conclusion and Future Research Needs 
This chapter has illustrated how interacting dimensions of the complex nature of NYC, including intersecting social, 
ecological, and technological-infrastructure system domains, are essential to address in order to transition to a 
climate-adapted future that protects all New Yorkers. We reviewed a range of approaches to futures and scenario 
development processes as part of the emergence of scenario planning to guide decision-making for climate 
adaptation and mitigation in the city. We also reviewed community-based planning and opportunities to integrate 
community and stakeholder ideas about what would make NYC more livable, equitable, and resilient. By assessing 
these current approaches to future visioning and scenarios across community and city level initiatives and examining 
these diverse dimensions of the NYC system to reduce risk and vulnerability, we find that city as well as a multitude 
of community organizations are engaged in a wide range of adaptative planning; although  these are largely oriented 
to near-term objectives and strategies and are mostly framed around sectoral concerns. 
While long-term visioning has been part of the City’s planning efforts in the past, no current plan, let alone a 
demographic forecast, matches the end of century dates of the climate projections, and represents a gap in long-term 
planning need to guide NYC decision-making that looks beyond the near term to actions now that will impact the city 
later this century. The future NYC will be increasingly older, and there is little to suggest that it will not continue to 
thrive as a diverse city. But whether the NYC of 2100 is more or less populous than today is unknown. Further, 
whether future New Yorkers increasingly live in flood-prone neighborhoods or heat-prone housing – let alone whether 
such risks will be born unequally according to race and ethnicity, or socioeconomic or nativity status – remain 
unknown. Yet these unknowns are modifiable by tools, planning and policy; and planning for a range of possible 
outcomes is increasingly necessary. Thus, there is need for increased multi-sector, multi-hazard long-term planning

41 
initiatives, and future research can help to evaluate, assess, and monitor the progress of these planning initiatives, as 
well as the capacities and collaboration of community-based organizations and government entities to implement the 
plans. 
Though the are many tools that could drive policymaking and decisions about how to prioritize investments, BCA 
remain influential in deciding what gets built (or invested in), how, and by whom. BCA of policies and future 
investments still have not typically included valuation of costs associated with climate-sensitive health conditions. 
Including health-related costs in these analyses can more fully capture the benefits of avoidable health costs and be 
more forward-looking by accounting for future population shifts and future climate projections. Additionally, health 
impact assessment can be a useful tool for estimating health co-benefits of climate actions and assessing their 
distributional equity. Such tools are already well established, but their application to climate adaptation and mitigation 
is still new and therefore underutilized. 
Many aspects of the built environment (such as infrastructure) have been addressed by prior NPCCs. In this chapter, 
we took a novel look at NYC’s public ROW (streets and sidewalks) and found that this valuable shared resource has 
the wide potential to be transformed to better support climate adaptation, health, and equity. Near-, medium-, and 
long-term changes to how streets, sidewalks, and other public spaces that are part of the public ROW are designed, 
governed, and managed at different spatial scales can begin to reverse maladaptive uses and enable a more 
sustainable future, yet aspects of the public ROW need to be incorporated in a range of planning and knowledge-
gathering initiatives. This chapter did not review issues in the housing sector in any detail, and notes that housing 
quantity and quality remains an important issue for future NPCCs to address fully. 
People and nature co-exist in NYC, but NBS are often siloed despite acknowledgment of their many co-benefits 
including those on physical and mental health. Furthermore, the benefits of nature are not evenly distributed across 
the city. Thus, investment in NBS alongside other engineered and social approaches to adapting to increasing 
climate impacts may have broad potential. Examples of these adaptations can include increase investments and 
plans for natural area restoration, conservation, and protection alongside new hybrid and green infrastructure 
installations including expanding tree canopy and installing green roofs and bioswales. As noted above with health 
impacts assessment and BCA, NBS must include intentional equity dimensions in their implementation in order to 
ensure that they not do not reinforce or exacerbate historical inequities and that they work to making NYC more 
sustainable for all. 
Systems approaches such as that of the SETS framework are needed to ensure adaptation and mitigation decisions 
do not occur in siloes; rather they consider a range of futuring options that accommodate feedbacks to other sectors 
and subsystems. For example, mechanical cooling, while maladaptive in some applications, has helped reduce heat 
health impacts among vulnerable populations. Yet long-term investments in cooling the city to protect residents from 
high heat impacts need to consider nature-based and other systemic solutions to cool the city, while recognizing the 
need for mechanical cooling to reduce heat impacts during high heat events. Overall, maladaptive and wasteful uses 
in NYC buildings should be reduced to avoid increasing energy use and emissions as access is expanded. 
It is increasingly clear that equity and social justice are critical to inclusive climate adaptation goals, implementation 
efforts, and future planning. Centering equity in climate adaptation and mitigation actions provides an opportunity to 
decrease impacts on the most vulnerable while creating more inclusive processes that center community voices in 
climate adaptation and mitigation planning, policymaking, and investments decisions. This means that tools for 
planning must allow for explicit attention to equity concerns. 
Prior NPCCs have noted the need for regular and meaningful indicators of climate impacts in perpetuity. This NPCC 
finds equal imperative in the City’s commitment to regular and meaningful monitoring of adaptation progress. Such 
meaningful and transparent indicators, and related fora for exchange such as the CKE, are important so that the 
agencies of city government, and other civil actors, as well as the public can observe and engage in the city’s 
progress toward a more sustainable and equitable future. 
As part of the first NPCC Futures and Transitions Working Group, this chapter has contributed to imagining, visioning, 
and planning the future of NYC. It introduced frameworks that would allow for longer demographic projections 
consistent with socioeconomic futures that are plausible given a range of climate futures and social-ecological-
technological systems (SETS) that model complex urban dynamics with a range of cascading influences and 
feedbacks. These new frameworks offer longer-term scenarios to guide the decision-making today and, with 
continued use, in the future. Going forward, much work remains to be done to assess the alternative projections, 
visions and scenarios, and their inherent uncertainties, but so doing will build the necessary tools for a climate 
adapted, sustainable, and equitable future NYC.

Key Message 1 
NYC is projected to be hotter, wetter, and more flood prone, with multiple types of tropical and winter 
storms that are likely to increase in frequency, intensity, and severity. At the same time, the population of 
the city is expected to age. Long traditions of in- and out-migration have shaped the city and are 
expected to continue to be an important part of its future, anchoring it in the region and the nation. The 
built environment will largely remain in place, yet changes in land use and land cover, including in 
impervious and natural areas are expected. Managing and planning the future NYC to be more adapted 
and resilient to diverse climate, economic, and social pressures will require understanding these diverse 
futures that also interact dynamically in real-time. 
Description of 
Evidence 
The Climate Science Special Report (Braneon et al., 2024) lays out the future climate conditions for NYC. 
Projections of population, which describe future aging patterns and the total size of NYC’s population in 
the short and medium term, are produced by NYC’s Department of City Planning (2013) to 2040 and New 
York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) (New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, 
2020b) to 2055. Historical evidence shows that NYC has become increasingly diverse in terms of its 
racial and ethnic composition since 1950 (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2023b). See 
KM8 for evidence on changes to the natural environment.  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Population futures that match the temporal scale of the climate projections, out to 2100, do not yet exist, 
and therefore those uncertainties remain hard to describe (Balk et al., 2022). Evidence from work done 
for US States (Zoraghein & O’Neill, 2020a, 2020b) indicates that the total population of NYC at mid- and 
end of the century could be larger, smaller or about the same size as it is now, depending in part upon 
which climate future  is used to inform that future population trajectory. Such projections for NYC, that will 
include spatial downscaling in order to assess future impacts of climate hazards, are underway as part of 
Task 4 of the NYC Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation Assessment (VIA) project; these will project the 
population by race/ethnicity and age out to 2100.  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
The evidence that NYC will remain diverse, continue to be a home to migrants (both domestic and 
international), and that its population will become older (as will the rest of the country) is very high with 
strong evidence. Levels of each of these compositional characteristics is less certain, as is the spatial 
distribution.  
Key Message 2 
Future complexity and uncertainty due to climate change demands new ways to plan our cities. Scenario-
based planning can incorporate important urban dynamics and complexities and uncertainties common to 
the non-anecdotal challenges of the Anthropocene that other planning tools cannot, partly by addressing 
uncertainty over the mid-to-long term. By incorporating scenario planning into NYC futuring exercises, a 
range of new opportunities for envisioning and shaping health, social, environmental, economic, and 
population change outcomes can be applied to meet broad or sectoral adaptation and mitigation 
planning. 
Description of 
Evidence 
Scenarios, as future tools, have consistent internal logic and coherent narratives useful in addressing 
complexity and uncertainty (Díaz et al., 2019; Iwaniec et al., 2014; Moss et al., 2010; Reid et al., 2005). 
While these tools have been deployed at the global scale, less work has been done at regional or city 
scales (Reimann et al., 2021; Rohat et al., 2021). Historically, localities have focused on predictive 
scenarios or forecasts, that extrapolate future conditions based upon predefined models of historic and 
existing trends (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2013, 2023b) and are relatively short-term 
projections (Balk et al., 2022). Moreover, most of these plans focus on land use zoning needs based 
upon economic and population growth (see review in Balk et al.(Balk et al., 2022)). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Planners have started employing scenarios in local development analyses (Finn & Miller, 2022). While 
scenarios promise to provide new insight, issues to watch out for include adequate consideration of 
uncertainties, an overemphasis on “picking” a preferred future (Chakraborty et al., 2011), and a lack of 
effective public involvement (Bartholomew, 2007).  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Localities could use scenario planning in a variety of development plans (High Confidence). Questions 
remain, however, about how best to move forward and incorporate scenario approaches in both private 
and public planning exercises.

Key Message 3 
Equity and social justice should be explicitly centered in future climate adaptation goals, implementation 
efforts, and future planning. Planning without centering equity will likely result in unintended negative 
consequences, such as gentrification or displacement, which exacerbate inequity. Centering equity in 
climate adaptation and mitigation actions provides an opportunity to decrease impacts on the most 
vulnerable.  
Description of 
Evidence 
Historical evidence shows that NYC has become increasingly diverse in terms of its racial and ethnic 
composition since 1950 (City of New York Department of City Planning, 2023a). Persons of color are 
more likely to lack air conditioning or report being unable to pay the added electricity cost amplifying the 
burden of future heat in communities of color (City of New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene, 2022d; Lane et al., 2014; Madrigano et al., 2015). For example, gentrification, or the 
displacement of populations from neighborhoods due to rising property values, increasing rents, 
upzoning, and other core gentrification drivers are an increasing concern among vulnerable communities 
in NYC (Foster et al., 2024). Additional evidence is reviewed in the NPCC4, Foster et al (Foster et al., 
2024).  
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Health impact assessment can be a useful tool for engaging community stakeholders in ways that 
enhance procedural equity and shed light on distributive equity of proposed actions (Foster et al., 2019; 
Sohn et al., 2018). Future population projections by race/ethnicity and that are spatially specific would 
also help the city guide response with an equity lens (Balk et al., 2022).  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Counterfactuals (that is, the ability to show the results had a given plan not been implemented) is hard to 
observe at a city scale, yet evidence from a variety of plans and programs with equity goals is a helpful 
precondition for equity goals to be met. Very high confidence and strong evidence. 
Key Message 4 
NYC is dynamic, and the scale and complexity of NYC requires managing interacting socio-economic, 
ecological-biophysical, and technological-infrastructure components. However, there is often a lack of 
understanding by planners of the fundamental drivers of behaviors and patterns that are important for 
planning and designing more resilient, equitable, and adapted NYC and metropolitan region. Inherent in 
these interdependencies are trade-offs between temporal and spatial scales in planning activities, as well 
as between sectors; identifying these trade-offs is integral to transparency in planning and adaptation. 
Incorporating approaches that acknowledge interdependencies in future planning will prevent a siloed 
understanding of trade-offs and uncertainties. 
Description of 
Evidence 
Cities have many interacting and interdependent social-economic, ecological-biophysical, and 
technological-infrastructure systems and NYC is at risk from climate change precisely because of its 
dense concentration of people, infrastructure, and economies. Transforming NYC to be flexible, adaptive, 
and resilient requires the capacity to build, design, and plan for complexity (Chester et al., 2023; 
McPhearson, 2020). To ensure that climate solutions don’t create unintended trade-offs, or 
maladaptation, it is important to account for the interdependencies among social, ecological, and 
technological infrastructure components of urban systems (E. M. Cook & McPhearson, 2020; Grabowski 
et al., 2017; Grimm et al., 2016, 2017; McPhearson, 2020; McPhearson et al., 2021, 2022b; McPhearson, 
Iwaniec, et al., 2016). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Recent extreme events demonstrated failures or inadequacies not just in the built infrastructure but also 
in resources, institutions, information, and governance systems—components of the urban SETS—to 
prepare for, and respond to, events of this magnitude (Eakin et al., 2018). There also  remaining 
uncertainties in best practices for identifying and comprehensively assessing trade-offs across sectors 
and spatial and temporal scales to inform future decision-making (Zeckhauser & Wagner, 2019) . More 
research is needed on  approaches that focus on identifying trends and uncertainties that would allow 
decision makers to overcome  siloed or short-term planning as needed (Balk et al., 2022; Schoemaker, 
1995).  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
To advance governance for resilience means also advancing our ability to understand such complex 
urban dynamics and develop near and longer-term scenarios to guide decision-making. There is high 
confidence that without significant investment in transparency and cross-sectoral collaboration, there will 
continue to be siloed planning initiatives and unintended tradeoffs that will hinder future resilience and 
adaptation. There is high confidence and moderate evidence through a quickly emerging body of 
literature that a social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) approach can improve ability to examine 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

 Interim Report for Public Release 
44 
complexity of cities and examine trade-offs across sectors and scales. This body of literature is 
expanding globally, as well as for NYC empirical case studies.  
Key Message 5 
In the context of climate change risks in NYC and the metropolitan region, changes in key sectors and 
deployment of technologies have included some which are adaptive and beneficial and others that are 
unintentionally maladaptive, causing risks and inequities that are costly to reverse. The adaptive or 
maladaptive potential of such changes have depended on the extent to which their costs, benefits, and 
risks are balanced and equitably distributed. Local examples considered in this chapter include 
mechanical cooling, flood protection measures, and spatial allocation of the public right of way (ROW, 
mainly streets and sidewalks). Maladaptation can be caused by ignoring climate risks and equity 
considerations and by siloed planning, within and among sectors, levels of government, government 
agencies, non-governmental institutions, and the private sector. Potential for maladaptive and inequitable 
effects of climate adaptation strategies and other sectoral actions influencing climate risks should be 
weighed to ensure that near-term actions are not maladaptive in the long term.  
Description of 
Evidence 
Abundant and robust evidence shows that key technologies in NYC have been deployed in ways that 
have been both adaptive and maladaptive and inequitable; evidence-informed approaches can inform 
potential for adaptive and equitable sectoral transitions. Mechanical cooling of residences has greatly 
reduced deaths caused by hot weather in NYC and nationally (Petkova et al., 2014) (Barreca et al., 2013) 
and provides other health benefits (Matte et al., 2024). Widespread but inequitable access contributes to 
greater heat vulnerability in low-income and non-Hispanic Black populations (City of New York 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2022c; Lane et al., 2014; Madrigano et al., 2018).  Much 
larger sources of building energy consumption include space heating, provision of hot water, and space 
cooling in commercial buildings (City of New York, 2016). Building designs vary in their adaptation to hot 
weather (Urban Green Council, 2014)). Evidence concerning maladaptive and adaptive uses of the ROW 
is considered in KM 7. Evidence concerning maladaptive and adaptive flood protection measures is 
considered in NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al (B. Rosenzweig et al., 2024). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Emerging and future developments in mechanical cooling technologies, the potential efficacy of scaling 
urban heat island mitigation measures, future energy transition challenges (Yoon et al., 2024), and 
proposed new policies (City of New York Office of the Mayor, 2023) add uncertainty to forecasting future 
benefits, costs, and inequities that mechanical cooling might create. Uncertainties concerning the public 
right of way are considered in KM 7. Uncertainties concerning flood protection measures is considered in 
NPCC4, Rosenzweig et al (B. Rosenzweig et al., 2024). 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
There is high confidence that mechanical cooling, use of the ROW, and flood protection have been 
deployed locally in ways both adaptive and maladaptive and that it is feasible to begin transitions to more 
adaptive uses.  
Key Message 6 
Without shared positive visions for the future, it is unlikely that plans made now will achieve the equity, 
justice, sustainability, and resilience goals desired for the future of NYC and its communities. 
Participatory processes are critical in co-developing shared visions that bring together diverse 
perspectives and forms of knowledge, and a sustained engagement process is critically needed to 
identify the City’s climate research priorities and co-produce a future public climate research agenda for 
the city. Co-produced visions, goals, and strategies can involve perspectives across multiple sectors, 
scales, and communities to gather the full range of ideas, innovations, and possible actions to address 
trade-offs and inform transitions toward a climate-adapted future for NYC. However, tools for longer-term 
(beyond 2050) transitions and pathways to achieve future plans for NYC are currently missing and 
needed to guide efforts to secure an inclusive climate resilient future for all New Yorkers. In order to track 
progress towards these goals, periodic and systematic monitoring and evaluation are necessary.  
Description of 
Evidence 
Shared positive visions of the future can help to address the barriers to action of dystopian or negative 
framings of the future (Iwaniec et al., 2020; McPhearson, Iwaniec, et al., 2016). Co-production processes 
that bring together a range of perspectives and stakeholders have already been employed in NYC (City 
of New York, 2022; E. Cook et al., 2022). An analysis of government and community-based plans in this 
chapter indicated that most plans have short or mid-term timelines, and very few focus on the long-term 
(Figure 3).

New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
There are remaining uncertainties as to how to effectively engage community members and community-
based organizations and more meaningfully learn from and integrate their expertise into planning 
initiatives while addressing redundancies in community engagement across sectors or agencies (E. Cook 
et al., 2022). More research is needed on effective methods to evaluate progress on co-production and 
community engagement in planning. 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Without improved processes such as those that are co-produced or others that  are integrated into 
resilience planning, there is high confidence that we will continue to replicate historic trends and mistakes 
in resilience planning without the multiple perspectives and innovations that co-production processes 
generate. 
Key Message 7 
Transitioning the built environment to be more climate resilient while addressing fundamental challenges 
to equity and sustainability requires policies and investments to retrofit, rebuild, and improve the built 
infrastructure to support population health. Prioritizing active and sustainable modes, including transit, 
walking, and cycling can provide multiple, equitable health benefits through increased physical activity, 
reduced air pollution exposure, more affordable transportation options, and reduced risk of conditions that 
increase vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, reducing miles driven by private motor 
vehicles within, into, and out of the city will reduce greenhouse gas remissions and expand space 
available on streets and sidewalks for uses that provide climate resilience and social and equity benefits. 
Description of 
Evidence 
Extensive evidence shows that active transportation modes, including public transit, promotes regular 
physical activity that confers multiple health benefits (Besser & Dannenberg, 2005a; Edwards, 2008a; 
Gaesser & Angadi, 2021; Heath et al., 2012a; Saint-Maurice et al., 2022; The Community Guide, 2017) 
(Besser & Dannenberg, 2005b; Edwards, 2008b)  (Dutch Cycling Embassy (DCE), 2023; Nello-Deakin & 
Brömmelstroet, 2021). Studies also show that policies promoting motor vehicle traffic cause congestion in 
densely populated areas, increase exposure to air pollution (Bosson et al., 2019; Khreis et al., 2017; 
Yang et al., 2018) and increase crash risks for pedestrians; these risks are inequitably distributed 
(Kheirbek et al., 2016a; Lubbe et al., 2022; Smart Growth America, 2022). Such policies also limit space 
available for safe, healthy, active modes. Spatial allocation of NYC’s public right of way (ROW, mostly 
streets and sidewalks), has prioritized the movement and parking of private motor vehicles (Czebotar, 
2021; Freudenberg et al., 2021) over more spatially efficient modes (National Association of City 
Transportation Officials, 2016). The amount of paved impervious surface required contributes to climate 
risks from heat and flooding (Mohajerani et al., 2017) (Madrigano et al., 2015; B. Rosenzweig et al., 
2024). Potential strategies and examples of adaptive transition of the ROW have been described and 
demonstrated in NYC and elsewhere (Freudenberg et al., 2021) (Aaron, 2011; Brugge et al., 2015; Pestel 
& Wozny, 2019; Zhai & Wolff, 2021) (City of New York, 2019; City of New York Department of 
Transportation, 2023c, 2023b, 2023a) (City of New York Department of Transportation, 2022; Sam 
Swartz, 2019). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Emerging changes in the transportation sector within and around NYC create opportunities, 
implementation challenges, and some uncertainty about the potential for transitions that provide health 
and environmental co-benefits. These include the advent and implementation of congestion pricing 
(Slevin, 2019), electrification of buses (Sustainable Bus, 2022; Zhou et al., 2016), state and national 
subsidies promoting battery electric private vehicles, which share most maladaptive features of fossil 
fueled vehicles (Kelly & Zhu, 2016; Requia et al., 2018), and the expanded use of delivery apps and 
motorized two wheeled vehicles (Cohen, 2023; DiMaggio et al., 2020).  
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Despite challenges and uncertainties, there is high confidence that sustainable and active transportation 
investments and policies, including reallocation of space on streets and sidewalks can advance NYC 
health, equity, and environmental goals.  
Key Message 8 
Nature-based solutions are critical for addressing climate adaptation needs in the city and can 
simultaneously provide co-benefits for public health, society, and natural systems that help create a 
resilient city. Planning, implementation, and management of nature-based solutions to achieve equitable 
distribution and holistic resilience in a complex city system is still a developing practice.  
Description of 
Evidence 
Nature-based solutions have the potential to provide many climate adaptation services in cities and when 
strategically designed to do so, have the potential to simultaneously provide health, social, economic, and 
ecological co-benefits that improve the well-being of people and support biodiversity and the function of

ecosystems (Campbell, Cheng, et al., 2021; Keeler et al., 2019; R. McDonald & Beatley, 2021; R. I. 
McDonald et al., 2023; McPhearson et al., 2022b). 
New Information 
and Remaining 
Uncertainties 
Measuring the delivery of social-cultural benefits and the avoidance of disservices is still a developing 
and evolving practice that needs to be more fully developed to measure whether NBS deliver promised 
co-benefits and avoid unintentional disservices (Andersson et al., 2021; Campbell, Cheng, et al., 2021; 
Hoover et al., 2023; Wickenberg et al., 2021; Wijsman et al., 2021). The Forest for All NYC coalition is an 
ongoing collaborative effort with great potential that incorporates procedural and distributional equity in an 
effort to advance equitable expansion of the Urban Forest in NYC so that it can benefit all New Yorkers 
(NYC Urban Forest Task Force, 2021). 
Assessment of 
Confidence based 
on the Evidence 
Because measuring effectiveness is a developing field, with some early evidence (e.g. Campbell et al. 
(Campbell, Cheng, et al., 2021)) there is medium confidence that if NBS are designed and implemented 
with social-cultural benefits and avoidance of disservices like green gentrification as central to their 
project goals, that they can be successful and contribute to holistic resilience for the city. The Forest for 
All NYC coalition, established in 2021, is new enough that there are not yet measurable outcomes of the 
anticipated social and cultural benefits.

1 Introduction 
The New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) was established to help the city “prepare for and mitigate the 
expected impact of climate change on New York City's communities, vulnerable populations, public health, natural 
systems, critical infrastructure, buildings and the economy” (LL42). As an assessment, the NPCC reviews recent 
advances in biophysical climate science and social science to provide policy-relevant guidance to the city. NPCC4 
builds on the prior three NPCC assessments, providing climate projections while deepening areas of prior reports on 
flooding, health, and equity. It crafts two new areas of emphasis – on energy and energy insecurity, and tools for 
future visioning and planning – that further understanding of the impacts of climate risks on the human and ecological 
systems of New York City (NYC). 
Navigating present and future climate risks and related socio-economic challenges facing the city will require 
tradeoffs and compromises forged through constructive and scientifically informed public dialogue. To plan and act, 
community-based organizations, businesses, city government, and other stakeholders will need to continue to 
integrate scientific and technical information with community values and knowledge. Scientific and technical 
information are critical to addressing the challenges the city faces and to understanding the technologies and 
measures that are available to meet them. Scientific and technical information can provide insights and guidance that 
inform, for example: how to update codes and standards (e.g. Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines) so that new and 
renovated structures are resilient and efficient; how to identify where, and what kind of flood protection should be 
prioritized; how to estimate the service loads public infrastructure for stormwater management, sanitation, electric 
power, and water supply will need to bear; and how to plan public health strategies to manage cascading and 
compounding extreme events (e.g. co-occurrence of storms, power failures, and heat waves). Community 
perspectives and local knowledge1 provide an essential compass to help navigate issues such as growing economic 
opportunities, improving social welfare, planning transportation systems, and improving access to nature-based 
solutions that contribute to multiple dimensions of well-being. Local knowledge offers complementary information and 
expertise to bio-physical and social science, ensuring that, as the city prepares for the future, it does so in a way that 
increases civic participation, social cohesion, and community stewardship, all indicators of resiliency. Evidence 
suggests the integration of different forms of local knowledge (e.g. NOAA’s Urban Heat Island mapping program) can

they live. It can contribute to effective land management, predictions of natural disasters, and identification of longer-term climate 
changes, and LK can be particularly useful where formal data collection on environmental conditions may be sparse (IPCC).

improve decision-making associated with climate risk management and community stewardship of, and commitment 
to, climate resiliency initiatives (Anthony, 2023; Carmona et al., 2023; Hurlbert et al., 2019). 
2 Chapter Summary  
This chapter provides an overview of the major themes, findings, and recommendations from NPCC4. It presents 
summary statements from each chapter of the assessment which identify salient and pressing issues raised and 
provides recommendations for future research and for enhancement of climate resiliency. The chapter also outlines a 
set of broader recommendations for future NPCC work and identifies some key topics for the next assessment. 
2.1 
Climate Science 
New York City faces many challenges due to climate change and its interactions with social vulnerabilities and 
uneven urban development patterns and processes. In its assessment, NPCC4 confirms new sea level rise, 
temperature, precipitation, and extreme events projections of record for use by NYC, and presents a new 
methodology related to climate extremes. 
Sea level is projected to rise for centuries and remain elevated for thousands of years. Glaciers and ice sheets 
combined are now the dominant contributors to global mean sea level rise. Coastal locations in the NYC metropolitan 
region continue to experience higher rates of relative sea level rise as compared to the global mean. 
Surface and air temperature varies throughout NYC as a function of time of day, season, and the underlying 
characteristics of the built environment. The number of days with minimum temperatures below freezing has been 
steadily declining since 1900. The total number of hot days in the city and the frequency and duration of heat waves 
are expected to increase as this century progresses. Although the increase in total annual precipitation is projected to 
be relatively small, global climate models project somewhat larger increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation 
events.   
2.1.1 
Recommendations for Future Research 
■ 
Indoor heat exposure is the most common cause of both heat-related and heat-exacerbated deaths in NYC. In 
order to better understand indoor heat exposure and address its impacts (e.g., morbidity, mortality), there is a 
need for research to quantify the climate and infrastructure drivers of indoor temperature extremes.  
■ 
More research is needed on the meteorological factors that contributed to extreme precipitation events like the 
remnants of Hurricane Ida that adversely impacted the NYC metropolitan region. 
■ 
Projected sea level rise for NYC will exacerbate the destructive hazards posed by storm surges and cause 
more frequent high-tide flooding. More research is needed on both the baseline storm surge hazard (e.g., 
extreme wave heights, expected damages) as well as its potential future changes (e.g., inundation area and 
extent). 
■ 
The compound effect of climate hazards and stressors (e.g., pluvial flooding, high wind speeds, and storm 
surge) can play an important role in exacerbating climate impacts. More research is needed on compound 
extreme events (e.g., tropical cyclone-blackout-heatwave events). 
2.1.2 
Recommendations for Climate Resiliency 
■ 
Although many improvements have been made to protect neighborhoods and secure critical infrastructure in 
future floods, many neighborhoods remain vulnerable to coastal flooding. Long-term planning needs to 
examine plausible scenarios at the upper tail of the projected sea level rise distribution, and meaningfully 
engage communities in planning processes. 
■ 
In order to better understand indoor temperature change and address its impacts, there is a need for (1) 
operational monitoring of indoor temperatures to map the spatial distribution of indoor hazardous heat as well 
as (2) better communication and warning systems when hazardous indoor conditions can be expected.  
■ 
Consideration of water management under drought currently relies on estimates of imbalances between 
annual supply and evaporative losses, but droughts are a manifestation of the non-linear interaction between 
supply and demand as the climate risks faced by water users vary over time and by sector of use. There is a 
need for more comprehensive assessment of drought vulnerability that accounts for projected changes in 
cross-sectoral demand as well as projected climate impacts.

2.2 
Flooding 
NYC faces risk from four types of flooding: pluvial, fluvial, coastal, and groundwater, which can occur individually or in 
combination. In the absence of adaptation projects supporting comprehensive Flood Risk Management (FRM), the 
risks associated with all four of these types of flooding will increase due to sea level rise and the intensification of 
precipitation expected with climate change. Incremental flood adaptation measures scaled to singular 
conceptualizations of future conditions can lead to maladaptation. Comprehensive FRM must include neighborhood-
specific combinations of structural (e.g., grey) and non-structural (e.g., green) approaches for living with water. These 
approaches must be implemented across multiple systems and scales, selected through collaborative processes, and 
be synergistic with the needs and goals of communities. To contribute to a comprehensive flood strategy, natural and 
nature-based solutions (NNBS) would need to be integrated extensively, and in novel new ways, to an urban 
ecosystem that has been modified profoundly over centuries of development. Progress is being made, but more 
information is needed regarding the extent and magnitude of flood hazards, exposure, and vulnerability, accompanied 
by greater cross sector, cross scale collaboration and decision-making.  
2.2.1 
Recommendations for Future Research 
■ 
Additional research is necessary to develop hazard maps that represent a broader range of flooding hazards 
and their increase in magnitude in response to anthropogenic climate change. This includes the continued 
development and integration of high-resolution models that can be used to simulate coastal hydrodynamics, 
sewer, surface, and groundwater flows in the same modeling platform.  
■ 
A denser network of gauges that record subhourly rainfall, water level, and flow in local streams, creeks, and 
sewers, and groundwater monitoring wells instrumented with water level loggers and salinity/conductivity 
probes are needed to calibrate and validate numerical models and in order to understand how climate is 
changing the city’s hydrology at the spatial scales relevant for flood resilience. 
■ 
Collect and share -- with relevant agencies, researchers, and communities -- additional data on flood-prone 
buildings, including location and the vertical distribution of people and utilities to prioritize adaptation 
investments.  
■ 
Qualitative and quantitative social science research is needed to comprehensively assess the costs of flooding 
when it occurs in NYC to respond to climate events and to allocate resources equitably to mitigate harm. 
■ 
Research into how NNBS are impacted by flood/storm surge events, hydroperiod2 changes, rising water tables 
and salinization, complimented by applied research into if and how NNBS can be enhanced, restored, or 
created at the spatial scales that would be needed to mitigate the impacts of various flood hazards.  
2.2.2 
Recommendations for Climate Resiliency 
■ 
While traditional floodplain management can be an effective strategy for reducing exposure to fluvial floods, 
pluvial flood hazards affect a much larger percentage of the city. A landscape-scale approach is needed that 
integrates strategic and safe stormwater conveyance, retention, and storage appropriately into the built 
environment. This approach would include design redundancies that are needed to plan for the uncertainty 
associated with future conditions. 
■ 
To advance equity, community stakeholders must have agency in decisions regarding FRM, and especially 
those strategies that seek to advance the long term social and ecological transformations needed to promote 
resilience.  
2.3 
Equity 
Since the release of NPCC3 (2019), the City's climate-related equity work has become more explicitly focused on 
redressing environmental injustice and racial disparities. This includes the adoption of various laws and policies, 
internal institutional reforms, the formation of an Environmental Justice Advisory Board, and the incorporation of 
equity into risk assessments and resilience planning. There is, however, limited understanding of climate change 
impacts and adaptation needs at the community or neighborhood level and limited systematic data exists on city-
sponsored adaptation projects and resilience investments. Going forward, the City's climate-related equity work would 
benefit from more comprehensive data on disaggregated climate risks at the local level and tracking of city-sponsored

water at a location.

climate adaptation projects and resilience investments in different communities. Climate adaptation and resilience 
planning should also consider the ways that climate change challenges that NYC faces are inextricably linked to the 
bioregion’s early history and how climate risks for the most socially vulnerable populations are connected to both past 
and present land use decisions and their underlying inequities (See Foster et al., Section 3 (Foster et al., 2024)). 
Understanding the impacts of this history is vital for formulating effective policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt 
to climate change. Without the creation and implementation of climate policies and practices that promote racially 
equitable procedures and outcomes, the City will risk perpetuating these inequities in new forms.  
For example, climate displacement is an important dimension of social vulnerability to climate change and should be 
measured by the City. The City's ability to measure the risks of climate displacement at an appropriate scale, such as 
at the neighborhood level, could help determine whether and how new climate-resilient infrastructure or infrastructure 
investments might risk displacement. Without anti-displacement strategies in place, resilience-promoting investments 
can have inequitable outcomes. These strategies most often require prioritizing community-driven climate resilience 
approaches that mitigate the risk of displacement. 
2.3.1 
Recommendations for Future Research 
■ 
Collect and analyze more disaggregated climate risk data and systematic tracking of city-sponsored climate 
investments at the neighborhood level. 
■ 
Examine the relationship between the region's history and development patterns, including the legacy of land 
dispossession, rezoning, discriminatory policies such as redlining, and climate risks for socially vulnerable 
communities. 
■ 
Further develop combined climate displacement and social vulnerability (CDSV) metrics that integrate socio-
economic, climate risk, and evictions and housing data to improve information and planning concerning the 
risks of climate displacement at a fine scale (such as the census tract). 
2.3.2 
Recommendations for Climate Resiliency 
■ 
Promote anti-displacement adaptation and resilience approaches that incorporate an understanding of 
neighborhood history, take a holistic approach to reducing racialized vulnerability to climate shocks, include 
inseparable issues like housing and transit access, and recognize that the cost burdens of climate adaptation 
(e.g., higher energy costs, insurance premiums, relocation) disproportionately result in increased displacement 
risk to the most socially marginalized communities.     
■ 
Understand and seek to scale up the work of community-based organizations that have implemented climate 
adaptation initiatives attentive to the intersecting nature of climate risks, social vulnerability, and displacement. 
These initiatives provide multiple benefits including equitable access to renewable energy, affordable and 
efficient housing, and economic development strategies that promote equitable green, adaptation economies. 
■ 
Investigate and incorporate best practices from around the country and that promote integrated, affirmatively 
anti-racist, equitable, and just approaches to tackling climate (and related) risks. These include those that 
advance just transitions, community-led planning processes, and collaborative relationships between 
communities, civic organizations, and state and local government offices and programs. 
  
2.4 
Health 
Climate change-related health risks are a threat to all New Yorkers, but especially those most vulnerable because of 
age, poor health, racial and social inequities, and social isolation. Inequities in household and neighborhood physical 
environments also mediate vulnerability to health impacts of climate change. Most important among climate health 
risks are those from hot weather and flooding. A changing climate could also increase exposures to air pollution, 
pollen and mold, mosquito and tick vectors of human illness, and water contaminants. Addressing key environmental 
and social drivers of vulnerability is an essential adaptation strategy. Many current City policies and strategies, (e.g., 
improving access to residential air conditioning, tree planting), aim to accomplish this. These efforts can be informed 
and evaluated using data on climate-health vulnerabilities, such as components of the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) 
and the Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI).  
2.4.1 
Recommendations for Future Research 
■ 
While it is known that housing condition, construction, and location influence vulnerability to climate risks, key 
knowledge gaps should be addressed in future research. These include indoor temperatures and health risks

in different types of structures and the spatial distribution of social and housing vulnerability to flooding, 
including the location of basement dwellings.

While temperature and humidity both influence heat stress and health risks, to better design climate adapted 
buildings and outdoor environments, a better understanding is needed of the relationships between heat and 
humidity under a changing climate. 
■ 
Social isolation has been clearly established as a strong, independent risk factor for poor health and has a 
plausible influence on vulnerability to a variety of climate hazards. However, evidence of the role of social 
isolation in climate vulnerability is inconsistent, in part because it is difficult to measure, and standardized 
measures are not collected through census or other health surveys. Future research should assess how 
different dimensions of social isolation are best measured, study how these influence climate vulnerability, and 
develop and evaluate effective interventions.   
2.4.2 
Recommendations for Climate Resiliency 
Because the built and natural environment shapes vulnerability to health impacts from climate change, creating more 
climate-adapted and resilient environments for vulnerable people and communities must be a priority. Climate actions 
and investments and policies in sectors that shape climate vulnerability must reduce longstanding racial, social, and 
economic inequities, especially in key sectors such as housing, energy, and transportation.  
■ 
Sectoral policies and investments that can advance climate resilience in vulnerable communities include 
expanded residential cooling access, flood-protected residential building mechanical systems, improved 
energy affordability, reliability, and backup systems, mandating window screens, and expanding the supply of 
affordable, healthy, safe housing to provide alternatives to flood-prone basement dwellings.  
■ 
Social factors also mediate vulnerability to climate health risks. Thus, investments and programs that 
strengthen community cohesion and social infrastructure are also needed.  
■ 
Vulnerable and marginalized communities should also be the focus of efforts to improve and evaluate 
communication strategies intended to promote awareness, preparedness, and timely response to warnings. 
2.5 
Energy & Energy Insecurity 
The urgent need to reduce energy use and GHG emissions in NYC, in alignment with NY State’s ambitious climate 
goals, brings to light significant challenges and opportunities. Key among these challenges is the management of 
energy insecurity (EI), which poses direct and indirect threats to public health and well-being, especially among 
vulnerable populations such as low-income groups, communities affected by systemic racism, individuals with health 
conditions and renters. The transition to renewable energy and the electrification of infrastructure, while offering 
prospects for local economic investment and improved air quality, must be navigated carefully to ensure energy 
affordability and reliability, particularly during extreme weather events. This transition exacerbates existing 
vulnerabilities and introduces new risks, particularly for those already facing EI.  
2.5.1 
Recommendations for Future Research 
■ 
Investigate the long-term health impacts of energy transitions on vulnerable populations, including those 
experiencing EI. 
■ 
Explore the effectiveness of existing policies and interventions aimed at reducing EI and their impacts on 
health outcomes. 
■ 
Examine the relationship between renewable energy adoption, energy infrastructure resilience, and community 
health, with a focus on environmental justice communities. 
■ 
Assess the health and safety implications of new energy technologies, such as battery storage, especially in 
dense urban environments like NYC. 
■ 
Expand available data on household energy use and outage data to assess with an equity lens. 
2.5.2 
Recommendations for Climate Resiliency 
■ 
Develop and implement policies to ensure that the benefits of energy transitions, such as improved air quality 
and reduced GHG emissions, are equitable and accessible to all communities, especially those historically 
affected by environmental injustice.

■ 
Enhance the resilience of the energy infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, prioritizing 
investments in areas with high vulnerability to power outages and EI. 
■ 
Foster community-led renewable energy initiatives and expand access to renewable energy sources and 
energy efficiency programs in low-income and minority communities, reducing both energy costs and health 
risks. 
■ 
Strengthen regulations and safety standards for new energy technologies, such as e-mobility devices, to 
mitigate risks and ensure public safety. 
2.6 
Futures and Transitions 
NYC is dynamic, and the scale and complexity of the city requires managing interacting socio-economic, ecological-
biophysical, and technological-infrastructure components of the urban system. Managing and planning the future 
NYC to be more adapted and resilient to diverse climate, economic, and social pressures will require understanding 
diverse futures that also interact in real-time. As climate change unfolds, the future NYC will be increasingly older, 
and there is little to suggest that it will not continue to thrive as a diverse city. But whether the NYC of 2100 is more or 
less populous than today is unknown. Long traditions of in- and out-migration, which shaped the city historically, are 
expected to continue to be an important part of its future, anchoring it in the region and the nation While long-term 
visioning has been part of the City’s planning efforts in the past, no current plan, let alone a demographic forecast, 
matches the end of century dates of the climate projections, and represents a gap in long-term planning need to 
guide NYC decision-making that looks beyond the near term to actions now that will impact the city later this century.  
The City’s built environment will largely remain in place, yet changes in land use and land cover, including 
conversions in impervious and natural areas, are expected. While NYC planning has often focused on immediate, 
short-term land use decisions and includes some community participation, planning for the future requires the use of 
tools for addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in climate change and need to include medium- to 
long-term time-horizons and attention to local variation in physical and socioeconomic characteristics. Incorporating 
approaches that acknowledge sectoral interdependencies in future planning can prevent a siloed understanding of 
trade-offs and uncertainties. 
Natural and nature-based solutions (NNBS) are critical for addressing climate adaptation needs in the city and can 
simultaneously provide co-benefits for public health, climate mitigation, flood risk management, and habitat for 
biodiversity. Yet, planning, implementation, and management of NNBS to achieve equitable distribution and holistic 
resilience in a complex city system is still a developing practice. Recognizing that the benefits of nature are not 
evenly distributed across the city, investment in NNBS to address this inequity alongside other engineered and social 
approaches to adapting to increasing climate impacts may have broad potential. Examples of these adaptations can 
include increase investments and plans for natural area restoration, conservation, and protection alongside new 
hybrid and green infrastructure installations including expanding tree canopy, installing green roofs and bioswales.  
2.6.1 
Recommendations for Future Research 
This first NPCC Futures and Transitions Working Group contributed to imagining, visioning, and planning the future of 
NYC. It introduced frameworks that would allow for longer demographic projections consistent with socioeconomic 
futures that are plausible given a range of climate futures and social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) that 
model complex urban dynamics with a range of cascading influences and feedbacks. Such frameworks – those that 
acknowledge inherent complexities in New York City -- are needed to ensure adaptation and mitigation decisions do 
not occur in siloes; rather they consider a range of futuring options that accommodate feedbacks to other sectors and 
subsystems. These new frameworks offer longer-term scenarios to guide the decision-making today and, with 
continued use, in the future. Developing and making meaningful use of such frameworks at the scale of NYC will 
require new research:  
■ 
Much work remains to be done to assess alternative visions and scenarios, and their inherent uncertainties, 
but so doing will build the necessary tools for a climate adapted, sustainable, and equitable future NYC.  
■ 
Future research needs to examine housing futures, nature futures, and the intersectionality of the built, social, 
and ecological futures and ways to minimized trade-offs that may emerge through short-term decisions 
underlining the need for long-term visions and plans.  
■ 
Prior NPCCs have noted the need for regular and meaningful indicators of climate impacts in perpetuity and 
the equity and flood chapters advance these in this assessment, but the role of indicators within the context of 
planning tools for the future is a gap that requires future research and assessment.

2.6.2 
Recommendations for Climate Resiliency 
Tools for longer-term (beyond 2050) transitions and pathways to achieve future plans for NYC are currently missing 
and needed to guide efforts to secure an inclusive climate resilient future for all New Yorkers. Participatory processes 
are critical in co-developing shared visions that bring together diverse perspectives and forms of knowledge, and a 
sustained engagement process is also critically needed to identify the City’s climate research priorities and co-
produce a future public climate research agenda for the city. Without such shared positive visions for the future, it is 
unlikely that plans made now will achieve the equity, justice, sustainability, and resilience goals of a future NYC and 
its communities. 
■ 
It is increasingly clear that equity and social justice are critical to inclusive climate adaptation goals, 
implementation efforts, and future planning. Centering equity in climate adaptation and mitigation actions 
provides an opportunity to decrease impacts on the most vulnerable while creating more inclusive processes 
that center community voices in climate adaptation and mitigation planning, policymaking, and investments 
decisions. This means that tools for planning must allow for explicit attention to equity concerns as well to 
resiliency in a multi-hazard world.  
■ 
Climate resiliency will need to adapt to future unknowns. Long-term planning that incorporates flexible 
adaptation pathways and uncertainty across many spatial scales, as determined by sectoral or community 
need, is imperative.  
3 Looking forward to NPCC 5 
NPCC4 confirms, with a high degree of certainty, that NYC’s future will be warmer -- including more extreme heat 
events that may lead to increased morbidity and mortality in summers, and wetter -- with specific risk from intense 
rainfall and inland flooding. Compound and cascading events are also very likely to expose the city to increased 
climate risk. Addressing the risks presented by climate change will require multiple levels of investment, innovation, 
and transformation across sectors including (but not limited to) housing, transportation, land use, ecosystems, and 
critical infrastructure. All of these efforts will require innovative urban climate action, planning, and investments. For 
NYC to achieve a more resilient, equitable, and adaptable future, intersectoral and multisectoral climate-forward 
planning will be necessary. These efforts need ongoing and urgent consideration now, as well as a continued 
commitment throughout the coming years. In this section, we offer suggestions and recommendations to help support 
the city and the next NPCC panel in these efforts. 
3.1 
Harness holistic, multi-disciplinary approaches that blend climate and related 
socio-demographic risks in the planning process 
Whether future New Yorkers increasingly live in flood-prone neighborhoods or heat-prone housing – let alone 
whether such risks will be born unequally according to race and ethnicity, or socioeconomic or nativity status (or 
many other socioeconomic characteristics) – depends on policy and a broader commitment to a just transition. These 
possible futures are modifiable by tools, planning and policy; and planning for a range of possible outcomes is 
increasingly necessary. Thus, there is need for increased multi-sector, multi-hazard long-term planning initiatives. 
There is also a need to evaluate, assess, and monitor the progress of these planning initiatives including attention to 
capacities and collaboration with community-based organizations and government entities to implement the plans.  
Future NPCC panels will, therefore, benefit from an interdisciplinary composition. While the exact composition of any 
panel will need to be determined by future priorities, the experience of NPCC4 is that those panels will need expertise 
from Earth, social, and health sciences as well as researchers from other allied academic fields including, but not 
limited to planning, architecture, law, business, humanities, and the arts. 
3.2 
Center equity in adaptation planning and decision making 
Equity and social justice should continue to be explicitly centered in future climate adaptation goals, implementation 
efforts, and future planning. Planning without centering equity will likely result in unintended negative consequences, 
such as green gentrification or displacement. Centering equity in climate adaptation and mitigation actions provides 
an opportunity to decrease impacts on the most vulnerable. The potential for maladaptive and inequitable effects of 
climate adaptation strategies and other sectoral actions influencing climate risks should be considered to ensure that 
near-term actions are not maladaptive in the long term.  
In addition to centering equity in the content of future assessments, it is important to also strive for representational 
equity in the composition of future panels and their working groups. One way of accomplishing this is to include early 
 
New York City Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment

 Interim Report for Public Release 
9 
career scholars and researchers that draw from a wide range of public and private New York area educational 
institutions and are diversified by rank, age, and experience, as well as by race, ethnicity, and economic status.  
3.3 
Evaluate and assess adaptation projects and initiatives 
Adaptation efforts require their own assessments, and that will start with stewardship from the City and its 
communities to undergo periodic self-evaluation. In order to meaningfully assess the value, efficacy and success of 
adaptation planning efforts in New York, the City’s adaptation actions must be monitored and evaluated over time 
(Blake et al., 2019; C40 Cities et al., 2019; Olazabal & Ruiz De Gopegui, 2021). It is especially important for New 
York City decisionmakers and stakeholders to understand which approaches to adaptation, including short-, medium- 
and long-term investments, are most effective in terms of reducing climate risk and enhancing resilience to the effects 
of climate change locally (Dinshaw et al., 2014) (New York City Panel on Climate Change, 2019). It will also be 
critical for the City to design adaption measures and strategies with evaluation and monitoring in mind (e.g. in situ 
measurements; indicators of climate exposure, vulnerability, risk or resilience; context-specific indicators of 
adaptation interventions) from the ideation stage (Boulanger, 2023).  
Monitoring and measuring the efficacy of adaptation measures has received only limited research attention and 
remains an important area for ongoing research. For example, the evaluation of the effectiveness of ecosystem-
based adaptation  and nature-based solutions (NBS) is still mainly based on modelling, and data from monitoring and 
in situ measurements remain fragmentary (Donatti et al., 2020; Sauvé et al., 2023).  If properly designed and used, 
adaptation metrics, indicators and monitoring can enhance local understanding of which types of adaptation measure 
are effective and why, as suggested by previous NPCC assessment reports (Blake et al., 2019; Leiter et al., 2019). 
3.4 
Improve the efficacy of climate risk communications 
To meet the myriad challenges posed by climate change, New York City will benefit from a concerted risk 
communication strategy that clearly outlines goals, objectives, and tactics for the many sectors of the City and 
customizes messages for the many different audiences. Climate risk communication in the context of municipal policy 
and planning decision-making operates at many levels, which makes such coordination challenging. Because climate 
change is deeply intersectional with impacts that are often unevenly distributed across race and economic status, no 
single report or communication strategy will suffice. Risk communication is also not a one-way, one-time process but 
instead is multi-directional and ongoing. Effective risk communication requires understanding different audiences’ 
needs and tailoring risk message content to meet those needs.  
Local Law 42 charges NPCC with the assessment of the most recent science and data regarding climate risk in New 
York City and providing advice on its communication to City residents. The wide range of this ambition suggests that 
the cycle of NPCC reports generates information that is valuable to share with groups as diverse as biophysical and 
social scientists, policy makers, planners, architects, engineers, community groups, and individuals at every level of 
educational attainment. Meeting these diverse needs can be challenging, especially given the practical constraints on 
the NPCC and the importance of ensuring the reliability and clarity of the information. Further, simply making this 
information available does not mean that audiences will seek it out or find it useful. NPCC4 has sought to balance 
these demands by delivering peer reviewed, subject specific assessments, a new web-based archive, and a series of 
summaries intended for a wide range of audiences. Future NPCC panels and New York City offices and agencies will 
benefit from continuing to innovate and evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of their climate risk communications. 
Engaging with community organizations and other stakeholders to provide input and feedback on proposed 
messages is one way to increase the value of risk communication and decrease the potential for unintended negative 
consequences. The more diverse audiences have access to this information the more inclusive and equitable the 
process of climate adaptation and mitigation will be. The science is clear that the City and its residents will need to 
change to meet the challenges of a climate altered present and future. Effective climate risk communication will be 
critical to ensuring that people understand why such change is necessary and how they can engage in meeting those 
challenges.  
3.5 
Learn from processes that make other Assessments run efficiently 
NPCC is designed by local law to ensure that those involved do not have conflicts of interest, and as such has been 
undertaken by researchers and academics who volunteer their time to the multi-year commitment required to conduct 
each assessment. This follows the model for service on the National Climate Assessment (NCA) and the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) but not the recent New York State Climate Impacts Assessment 
(NYSCIA), which provided small stipends for contributors. Importantly, all three of these other Assessment bodies 
have strong, financed support systems.  
Ensuring that NPCC is effective and inclusive of researchers from a variety of academic and research venues may 
require revisiting the Local Law 42 of 2012 requirement that NPCC panel members serve in a voluntary capacity.

 Interim Report for Public Release 
10 
Researchers from the non-profit sector, private sector, and those in grant-funded academic positions can make vital 
contributions to future NPCC efforts, but typically require some form of compensation in order to devote the 
substantial time required to serve on the NPCC.  
The NPCC also provides an invaluable opportunity for the training of students and new researchers. The NPCC4 
student internship program allowed student interns to participate in many of the work groups, but in contrast to the 
panel members, student members could not participate in a volunteer capacity. Thus, identifying resources to support 
and sustain a robust student internship/fellowship program is also an important part of the NPCC success as well as 
training the future workforce of adaptation professionals for the City. 
Support for the organization and production of the Assessment is also vital to the success and sustainability of future 
NPCC efforts. This includes administrative support for the organization of the panel’s work and report production, as 
well as resources for a robust co-production process, which engages city officials, agency representatives, as well as 
non-city entities such as non-profits and community groups. For example, NPCC4 had the good fortune of working 
with Climate Adaptation Partners to co-produce these structures for its Assessment for the first time. These structures 
will benefit from being strengthened for future assessments.  
3.6 
Key Topics for NPCC5 
Each NPCC report covers a limited set of topics that are relevant to the adaptation goals and planning of the city. All 
reports cover climate factors but the breadth of allied topics cycles through pressing needs and evolving sustained 
assessment frameworks. Below is a list of thematic areas that NPCC4 recommends receive attention in the next 
Assessment.  
■ 
Ecological Impacts and Natural and Nature-based Solutions: NNBS are critical for addressing climate 
adaptation needs in the city and can simultaneously provide co-benefits for well-being and public health, 
climate mitigation, flood risk management, and habitat for biodiversity. Yet, planning, implementation, and 
management of NNBS to achieve equitable distribution and holistic resilience in a complex city system is still a 
developing practice. Greater attention to the role and integration of NNBS in the City’s climate adaptation and 
mitigation plans is warranted. 
■ 
Housing risk and resiliency: Climate change threatens housing in many ways, both direct and indirect. While 
many chapters in this report touched on the housing sector, there is a need for more explicit attention to 
impacts of climate change on the housing sector including attention to the unhoused and precariously housed, 
housing affordability, housing shortages, and the conditions and resiliencies of the city’s housing stocks.  
■ 
Spatial and temporal scale dependencies: Climate risk is experienced over a range of spatial scales from the 
individual person to regional systems (e.g., drought). NYC residents and ecology are impacted at every scale 
from the street-level to the region, and, therefore, future NPCC assessments will need to work across a range 
of social and spatial geographies to support climate adaptation and mitigation in the city. This Assessment 
brought in a wide range of new temporal scales – from hourly flooding to long-term scenario planning – and 
points to the need to continue to expand on these scales as necessary (such as subhourly flooding, daily 
climate warnings or communications, end-of-century demographic futures). 
■ 
Infrastructure and built environment: While many aspects of climate risks associated with aspects of the city’s 
built environment and infrastructure systems have been addressed by prior NPCCs, there is a continued need 
for attention to the impacts of climate change on the city’s vital infrastructure systems (water, transportation, 
communication, energy, etc.), There is also a need to consider governance and management of these systems 
and to identify ways to enhance adaptation, health, and equity, and to align with mitigation efforts. For 
example, near-, medium-, and long-term changes to how streets, sidewalks, and other public spaces that are 
part of the public right-of-way are designed, governed, and managed at different spatial scales can begin to 
reverse maladaptive uses and enable a more sustainable future. 
4 Conclusion  
Local Law 42 created the NPCC to help “prepare for, [adapt to], and mitigate the expected impact of climate change 
on New York City's communities, vulnerable populations, public health, natural systems, critical infrastructure, 
buildings and the economy.”  This fourth report of the NPCC validates the critical role that science informed policy 
making plays in the creation of an equitable, resilient, and sustainable future for NYC.

Climate Change, Energy, and Energy Insecurity in New York City
Annex A: Energy Insecurity - Global, 
National, and Historical Context
Energy or fuel poverty are terms that have been used internationally to 
describe a lack of access or means to afford modern energy services 
and products needed for health and development.  In developing 
countries, a lack of clean household energy for cooking and heating1 is 
a major cause of preventable illness and death. While energy access is 
improving in many developing economies, by one estimate 733 million 
people without access to reliable electricity and 2.4 billion people using 
dangerous and inefficient cooking systems.2 Among this population, 
those that lack access to energy include those that simply cannot 
afford it. Access to electricity in the US is virtually universal, while in 
Malawi, for example, only about 11% of the population has electricity 
access3 and more than 95% of people depend on solid household fuels.  
Globally, household air pollution from use of solid fuels for cooking 
and other needs caused an estimated 2.3 million deaths in 2019, 
from causes including childhood pneumonia, COPD, heart disease 
and strokes, diabetes, low birth weight and preterm birth.4,5 Improving 
clean household energy access is a UN sustainable development goal 
(number 7).  
A lack of energy access and excessive cost burden also exists in 
developed economies.6 “Fuel poverty” was first studied intensively in 
the United Kingdom.7 As with energy insecurity, fuel poverty considers 
all essential energy services (not just heating), what is needed (not only 
what is used), and housing energy inefficiency as a major cause. 
In the United States, electricity came first to cities more than 100 
years ago, and the need to expand access was recognized. The rural 
electrification program beginning in the 1930s improved electricity 
access in rural areas from less than 10% to near-universal. Among 
other benefits, a decline in infant mortality has been attributed to this 
program.8 With modern energy connections becoming near universal 
in the US, excessive energy cost burden emerged as a major hardship 
for both urban and rural households. This concept has been the focus 
of many U.S. researchers who study the relative costs of energy to 
households. The energy burden focuses on the household energy bill as 
a percentage of the household’s annual income.
For New York State, the energy burden is defined as households that 
spend more than 6% of their annual income on energy.9,10 According 
to the US DOE's Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool 
the national average energy burden for low-income households is 
8.6%, three times higher than for non-low-income households which is 
estimated at 3%. In some areas, depending on location and income, 
the energy burden can be as high as 30%.11 Nevertheless, the extent of 
the energy household burden has been a persistent if underappreciated 
problem in the United States.12 For example, urban and rural low- 
income households (defined as 80% of area median income or 150% 
federal poverty level) spend roughly three times as much of their 
income on energy cost as compared to non-low-income households 
(7.2% and 9% versus 2.3% and 3.1%, respectively.13,14 Moreover, low-
income, African American, Latinx, multifamily and renter households 
are disproportionately impacted by high energy burdens.13 Out of a total 
of 118.2 million US households, in 2015, the US Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) estimated that 17 million households received an 
energy disconnect/delivery stop notice and 25 million households had to 
forgo food and medicine to pay energy bills.15
The results of the energy burden have been identified as energy 
insecurity, or the state in which households cannot meet their energy 
needs.16 This term refers to the uncertainty that a household faces 
in being able to make utility bill payments.17 The point emphasized 
from this concept is that the stress from insecurity creates significant 
health issues.18 For example, the results of energy insecurity include 
extreme home temperatures, hazardous heating alternatives, and the 
constant threat of utility shut-offs or mounting arrears in utility bills 
because of nonpayment. This problem is especially acute for low-income 
residents such as single parents, the elderly, the disabled, and others 
with low or fixed incomes.19,20 Those facing energy insecurity may be 
homeowners unable to invest in efficiency upgrades or may be renters 
living in housing units where landlords do not pay for the utilities and 
consequently have very little incentive to create more energy efficient 
units.21 Energy insecurity is an important issue in the US. The DOE 
EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) data for 2015 
suggest that 31% of U.S. households experienced some form of energy 
insecurity. That year, nearly seven million households had their access 
to heat interrupted at least once, and six million lost access to air 
conditioning at least once.22 Adequate housing and income are central 
to energy justice. Energy justice is a branch of environmental justice23,24 
focused on the notion that all individuals should have access to energy 
that is affordable, safe, sustainable and able to sustain a decent lifestyle, 
as well as the opportunity to participate in and lead energy decision-
making processes with the authority to make change.25–27 Energy justice 
scholarship stresses that neither the adaptation to climate change nor 
the renewable energy transition is inherently just nor democratizing in 
terms of the distribution of technologies and benefits.28 Energy justice 
is based upon disparities within energy systems closely associated with 
housing including, inter alia, notions concerning energy poverty, fuel 
poverty, energy burden and energy insecurity.

Annex B: 311 Calls for Summer Power 
Outages - Methods
Researchers tested whether the 311 calls were clustered, dispersed or 
randomly distributed throughout the city.29 Using spatial statistical test, 
the research found that there is a clustering of high numbers of 311-calls 
made between 2013 and 2022. That is, high numbers of calls were 
spatially clustered together as were low numbers of calls. A specific test, 
called the Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) demonstrated 
the location of these different levels of calls. The results of this analysis 
are presented in Annex Figure B-1 (left panel). Across most of the 
census tracts in the city, there is no clustering of calls amounts, but 
high numbers of calls are clustered in Northern Manhattan, parts of the 
Bronx, central Brooklyn, and Southeastern Queens. Areas designated as 
High-High (HH) signal locations of high absolute numbers of 311-calls for 
power outages (i.e., above the mean level of 311-calls for power outages 
per census tract) and where the adjacent census tracts also had High 
absolute number of 311-calls for power outages. The HH designation 
indicates areas of spatially clustered high levels of 311-calls for loss of 
power. Alternatively, areas designated as Low-Low (LL) are areas of low 
absolute numbers of 311-calls for power outages (i.e., below the citywide 
Annex Figure B 1. Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) results for 311 calls for power outages by census tract 
from January 1, 2014-January 1, 2023 (left). The distribution of percent population in poverty by quantile and census tract in 
New York City 2020 (right)
mean for 311-calls for power outages per census tract) and the adjacent 
cells are also areas of low absolute numbers of 311-calls for power 
outages.
Selected socio-economic characteristics of the census tracts with 
different levels of 311 calls were also examined. The research identified 
that there is an association between the levels of calls and the level of 
poverty within the different clusters. The distribution of those in poverty 
is presented in Annex Figure B-1 (right panel). A statistical test (student’s 
t-test) of the means of the percent poverty in census tracts in high call 
cluster areas and the percent of poverty in census tract of low call cluster 
areas is significant (t = 3.5806, df = 84.929, p-value = 0.0006).  
The results suggest that there is a significantly higher percentage of the 
population in poverty within census tracts with high numbers of calls 
compared to the percentage of population in poverty in census tracts 
with low numbers of calls. The mean percent in poverty in census tracts 
with high cluster calls is 26.0% and the mean percent of poverty in the 
census tracts with low cluster calls is 19.3%.

Climate Change, Energy, and Energy Insecurity in New York City
Annex C: Energy Transition Plans, Reliability, 
and Affordability - Challenges for NYC
As NYC addresses consistency with the Climate Leadership and 
Community Protection Act (CLCPA) and the commitment to carbon 
neutrality, there will be a growing need for technology and infrastructure 
that can improve efficiency and reliability. Over the course of the next 
few decades, New York State has committed to an energy transition. The 
transition is slated to occur through a decrease in use of fossil fuels to 
generate electrical power, while electrifying transportation and building 
energy services including heating, hot water, and cooking. Plans call 
for replacing fossil fuels with renewables including solar, wind, and 
hydropower.30 The role of nuclear power remains an open question. 
NYC will play a significant role in the energy transition, as the city’s 
energy use is a major share of state energy use (30%) and the city 
produces 40% of the state’s GHG emissions. The City also has 
committed to carbon neutrality by 2050.31 At the same time, the City 
faces significant challenges in reducing the use of fossil fuels, acquiring 
renewables and electrifying sectors. The City’s commitment to carbon 
neutrality is envisioned through the use of increased renewable energy 
generation, battery storage, and renewable energy transmission from 
up-State and beyond. All transportation and building energy demand 
are slated to be met by renewable electricity, meaning that electricity 
demand will increase dramatically. In order to meet low carbon fuel goals 
and reduce emissions, the City plans three important strategies:
1.	
Transform the electricity system to deliver 100% zero-emission 
electricity to buildings and the capacity to provide the same for 
more than a million zero emission vehicles (ZEVs);
2.	
Transform the current natural gas system to deliver low carbon gas 
(e.g., such as hydrogen or renewable natural gas) for end uses too 
costly and complex to fully electrify; and
3.	
Provide low carbon steam system for heating and cooling to some 
of the largest and most difficult buildings to decarbonize.32 
According to New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), given 
current trends and conditions, annual baseline energy use will increase 
from 49,230 GWh in 2023 to 68,810 GWh in 2050 (40% increase) 
and baseline peak demand is projected to increase from 11,023 MW 
to 13,200 MW over the same period.33 Energy storage to allow for 
renewable energy use is currently 22 MW and is projected to increase 
to 704 MW by 2050, and this storage will increase energy provision from 
3 GWh in 2023 to 686 GWh in 205033 (about 10% of annual electricity 
demand during that 2050 period). Two transmission lines will deliver 
renewable energy to NYC; the Champlain-Hudson Power Express 
(CHPE) project that will deliver hydropower from Canada directly to 
Queens, and the New York Power Authority (NYPA)-led proposal, known 
as Clean Path NY, which proposes to deliver renewable energy from 
upstate New York directly to NYC.  
There are at least four concerns to meeting carbon neutrality given 
current plans. The first is that many of the technologies to meet carbon 
neutrality goals are not yet commercially available. As a NYC study 
states, additional innovation is needed as battery storage technology is 
untested and undeveloped at the scale required to decarbonize NYC.32 
For example, Fekete et al.34 points out that current battery storage 
technologies have limited capacity that may not meet the need for base 
load given seasonal variation in renewable energy generation. Current 
research suggests that studies of net-zero decarbonization include 
carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).35 In fact, many studies suggest 
that CO2 emission reductions of great than 50% will not be possible 
without CCS.36 CSS was not considered in the City’s plans, suggesting 
contrary to research that the City’s transition could indeed reduce 
carbon emissions without it. New York State is currently in the process 
of defining what constitutes ‘zero emissions’ that meet CLCPA targets,37 
to which there have been environmental, equity and justice-related 
concerns about the implications of fuels and technologies that may be 
included (e.g., nuclear, biofuels, hydrogen).38
Second, there are reliability concerns with the transition to a larger 
role of the electricity grid. Recently, the New York Independent System 
Operator (NYISO) finds that thinning reliability margins over the next 
decade present increased challenges to reliability for NYC.39 NYISO 
quarterly assessment of reliability of the bulk electric system found a 
deficit in reliability margins for the NYC area beginning in summer 2025. 
The deficit is as large as 446 MW, driven primarily by the combination of 
a forecasted increase in peak demand (through the electrification of the 
transportation and building sectors, continued economic growth following 
the pandemic) and the unavailability of certain generators (Peaker 
plants).
Third, the electricity costs and affordability are important concerns. New 
York State is among the top 10 states with the highest electricity costs in 
the country. In 2023, cost of residential electricity was 21.92 cents/KWh 
compared to 15.92 cents/KWh for the country.40 Costs will be increasing, 
as in June 2023, Con Ed requested another increase in electricity 
rates resulting in a roughly 12% increase for customers over the next 
three years.41 These increases will go towards financing upgrades to 
the company's electricity delivery system, funding renewable energy 
plans and improving overall infrastructure. Continual rate increases can 
be critical for some NYC residents as approximately 610,000 families 
(representing 18% of total families in the city) pay greater than 6 percent 
of their household income and are therefore considered energy cost 
burdened.9 Moreover, as there are large areas in the city that have low 
hosting capacity there will be a need to further upgrade the electricity 
grid in these locations so as to provide equitable renewable energy 
access.
Finally, there is concern whether Con Edison will be able to provide 
enough electricity distribution necessary to meet the increased demand 
for heating and transportation during the transition and if this increase 
can be accomplished while keeping affordability in check.

NYSERDA currently has 
five offshore wind projects in 
active development, totaling 
more than 4,300 megawatts – 
nearly half of the State’s goal 
for 9,000 megawatts by 2030. 
In July 2022, NYSERDA 
launched a third offshore 
wind solicitation to procure 
at least 2,000 additional 
megawatts of offshore wind 
energy for New Yorkers.
In addition to greening 
the grid, the offshore wind 
industry can bring thousands 
of new jobs to NYC and 
help revitalize our working 
waterfronts–like the efforts 
currently underway to 
transform the South Brooklyn 
Marine Terminal into an 
offshore wind staging site.
New York has entered into 
agreements to provide new 
jobs to EJ communities. 
The New York City Public

has approved Equinor's 
design for the offshore wind 
operations and maintenance 
building to be constructed 
at the South Brooklyn

The approval from the PDC 
allows for advancement 
of New York's first-ever, 
purpose-built offshore wind 
operations and maintenance 
facility, marking an important 
step in revitalizing a working 
waterfront at this historic 
port. Jobs from this operation 
can help residents from 
disadvantaged communities.
