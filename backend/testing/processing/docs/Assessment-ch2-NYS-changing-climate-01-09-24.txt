New York State’s Changing Climate 
1 
Technical Workgroup Key Findings 
Many fundamental aspects of New York State’s climate have already begun to change, and the changes are 
projected to continue—and in some cases, accelerate—throughout the 21st century. This chapter explores 
observed and projected changes in a variety of physical variables that relate directly to weather and climate, 
starting with average and extreme air temperature and proceeding to the associated effects on precipitation, 
extreme events, and core properties of New York’s coastal and inland waters. These climate attributes and 
hazards lead to impacts throughout the eight sectors of this assessment.  
Key Finding 1: Average and maximum temperatures have increased in New York State since the 
early 20th century and are projected to continue to rise throughout the 21st century. The state has 
warmed more rapidly than the national average, and winter is warming more rapidly than other seasons. Heat 
waves are expected to occur more often and become more intense, posing greater risks for human health, 
built infrastructure, ecosystems, and other sectors. New York City is projected to remain the warmest part of 
the state; northern regions will continue to be relatively cooler while still experiencing large increases in 
temperature and extreme heat.  
Key Finding 2: New York State has experienced increases in total precipitation and heavy 
precipitation events, and these trends will continue through the end of this century. Heavy 
rainstorms that lead to flooding are projected to become more frequent across the state. Precipitation is 
expected to increase the most in winter. Lake-effect snowfall is projected to increase over the next few 
decades, but as temperatures continue to rise, more winter precipitation near the Great Lakes will fall as rain. 
Elsewhere in the state, snowfall and snowpack are likely to decrease with warmer winter temperatures. 
Key Finding 3: Climate change is creating conditions that will increase the frequency and severity 
of many types of extreme events. Several types of storms are expected to become more intense, with 
heavier rainfall, stronger winds, and higher storm surge along the coast driven by sea level rise. Short-term 
summer droughts could increase due to changing precipitation patterns and increased temperatures. Wildfires 
are unlikely to become much more common within New York State due to climate change, but air quality 
impacts from large fires elsewhere in North America could increase in the future.  
Key Finding 4: Sea surface temperature, sea level, and coastal flooding are increasing along New 
York State’s coast. Sea surface temperatures are rising more rapidly in the state than the global average. 
Sea level along New York’s coastline has risen almost 1 foot in the past century and is projected to increase by 
another 1 to 2 feet by mid-century, making chronic flooding more common in low-lying coastal neighborhoods. 
Ocean water is also becoming more acidic as it absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, although 
stormwater runoff currently has a larger effect on acidity in New York’s coastal waters. 
Key Finding 5: New York State’s lakes and rivers have experienced increased water temperature, 
fluctuating water levels, and decreased ice cover, and these changes are expected to intensify in 
a warmer, wetter future. Lakes are projected to experience more severe summer heat waves and 
decreased winter ice cover as temperatures rise in the coming decades. The Great Lakes could experience 
greater year-to-year variability in water levels, driven by periods of drought and extreme precipitation. Flood 
intensity and damages are expected to increase with extreme rainfall and broader changes in streamflow.

Introduction and Background 
Authoritative assessments of climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and 
the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) cite observed evidence of global and national-scale 
changes in a wide range of physical variables, including weather and climate (e.g., air temperature and 
precipitation averages and extremes), conditions in the Earth’s oceans (e.g., temperature, sea level), and 
conditions of the Earth’s cryosphere (snow and ice features).1,2 Many of the same changes have been 
observed in New York State, and projections from dozens of climate models agree that these changes will 
continue through the decades ahead. 
This chapter summarizes observed and projected changes in key physical variables within New York State. It is 
organized as follows: 
 This introduction briefly reviews the causes of global climate change; the sources of historical 
observation data incorporated into this assessment; and the sources, methods, and scenarios that form 
the basis for the projections of future change that were developed or otherwise selected for this 
assessment.  
 Subsequent sections describe observed and projected changes through figures, tables, and summary 
text. The sections are organized into major thematic groupings (temperature, precipitation, extreme 
events, ocean conditions, and lakes and rivers), each containing information about several specific 
variables. Each variable’s discussion presents both observations and projections to the extent they are 
available, to provide continuity and context.  
 A final section discusses compounding events.  
 The Traceable Accounts appendix examines each key finding in depth. It provides citations that support 
each assertion and it presents the authors’ assessment of confidence in each finding. 
Readers can find more detailed results in the full data package3 and accompanying methodology report4 for 
the future climate projections that were developed for this assessment. These materials are available on the 
assessment website.  
Historical observations and future projections for additional variables will appear within this assessment’s eight 
sector-based technical chapters. The sector chapters examine physical climate or impact variables that are 
uniquely associated with their specific sectors, whereas “New York State’s Changing Climate” presents 
information on fundamental weather and climate variables and other topics likely to be relevant to multiple 
sectors. For example, this chapter covers temperature averages and extremes in general, while the 
forthcoming Agriculture chapter discusses the length of the growing season, winter chill requirements for 
certain crops, and exceedance of specific temperature thresholds relevant to livestock health. 
2.1 The Causes of Global Climate Change 
Climate change is a global challenge driven predominantly by the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases 
in the Earth’s atmosphere due to human activities. A vast body of scientific work has established the 
fundamental science of climate change and its causation, as summarized in three decades of comprehensive 
global and national assessment reports. This statewide assessment therefore does not attempt to replicate or 
reexamine the physical drivers or attribution of climate change, choosing instead to refer to the clear and 
authoritative work that has already been published by the IPCC and the USGCRP. The most recent 
assessments published by these bodies include the following conclusions:

 “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land. Widespread and 
rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.”5 
 Human activities are changing the climate. The evidence for warming across multiple aspects of the 
Earth system is incontrovertible, and the science is unequivocal that increases in atmospheric 
greenhouse gases are driving many observed trends and changes. There are more greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere primarily because humans have burned and continue to burn fossil fuels for 
transportation and energy generation. Industrial processes, deforestation, and agricultural practices also 
increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As a result of increases in the atmospheric 
concentrations of these heat-trapping gases, the planet is on average about 2°F (1.1°C) warmer than it 
was in the late 1800s. No natural processes known to science could have caused this long-term 
temperature trend. The only credible explanation for the observed warming is human activities.6 
 “Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally 
caused by human activities.”5 
 “Human influence has warmed the climate at a rate that is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 
years.”5 
 “Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least mid-century under all emissions 
scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless 
deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades.”5 
The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (2021) notes that “Climate change is already affecting every inhabited 
region across the globe.”5 The New York State Climate Impacts Assessment explores the physical, societal, and 
ecological impacts of the specific changes that have been observed or projected to occur in New York.  
2.2 Historical Observations 
Historical observations presented in this chapter come from high-quality data collection programs, typically 
operated or coordinated by government agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Weather Service. In selecting sources for inclusion, the assessment team 
has attempted to find the longest available temporal record that also provides strong spatial coverage of New 
York and an assurance that data have been collected and processed consistently over time and space. Where 
possible, this chapter uses analyses that have already been vetted against data quality criteria for inclusion in 
collections such as the USGCRP’s indicator platform, NOAA’s Climate at a Glance tool, and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) climate change indicator suite. 
Some climate-related variables lack reliable long-term historical records. In such cases, this chapter presents 
whatever credible information is available but acknowledges its limitations.  
This chapter does not claim that all changes observed to date are unequivocally attributed to human-caused 
climate change. Nonetheless, other literature has established causal links for many of the observations 
presented here. 
2.3 Projections of Future Change 
Many of the projections presented here come from analyses performed specifically for this assessment by a 
team at Columbia University. The Columbia team developed projections using the most recent suite of global 
climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6), representing the 
state of the science in climate modeling and consistent with the most recent IPCC assessment (AR6) and the 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2

Fifth National Climate Assessment. Columbia statistically downscaled the global model outputs to provide 
regional resolution within New York by aligning modeled hindcast results with observational data from 27 long-
term weather stations across the state, using a baseline period of 1981–2010 to represent recent conditions. 
At the time the assessment process began, this baseline was the most recent three-decade period that had 
complete observed data as well as hindcast data from all the GCMs that the assessment team used. All 27 
stations had sufficient data to project average temperature and precipitation conditions into the future, while 
19 of them had sufficient data to project extreme temperature and precipitation events. These data were used 
to present projections for 12 regions of New York. The modeling team projected future sea level change for 
three locations that have many decades of historical water level data. Figure 2-1 shows the assessment 
regions along with the locations of all stations described above. 
The Columbia team’s projections include many commonly examined measures of climate change and its direct 
effects—for example, average and extreme temperature, average/total and extreme precipitation, and sea 
level change. However, their efforts do not cover every possible variable of interest. This chapter presents 
projections of selected additional variables based on what the assessment team judged to be the best 
available published sources. These sources include CMIP6 and CMIP5 results published in other recent climate 
assessments or scientific literature, as well as a regional model based on CMIP5 GCMs but optimized with 
additional knowledge of the hydrodynamics and land–water–atmosphere interactions of the Great Lakes and 
their surrounding region. 
All projections identify a corresponding climate scenario 
or trajectory. Most, including the Columbia team’s 
projections for this assessment, reference the commonly 
used Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenario 
framework. SSPs are defined by a set of socioeconomic 
development narratives and delineate future greenhouse 
gas emissions trajectories.7,8 Table 2-1 provides a 
reference to five of the most commonly used scenarios, 
including descriptive terminology that this assessment 
will use for consistency with other authoritative sources. 
For context, the table also identifies the projected global 
average surface temperature change associated with 
each scenario, according to the IPCC AR6. To provide a 
single range of possibilities that might be relatively more 
useful to many of this assessment’s users, most of the 
projections in this chapter present an unweighted 
combination of the results from two SSPs: middle of the 
road/intermediate emissions (SSP2-4.5) and fossil fueled 
development/very high emissions (SSP5-8.5).  
 
Box 1  How this chapter presents 
projections 
Unless noted otherwise, projections presented in 
this chapter represent an unweighted 
combination of the results from SSP2-4.5 and 
SSP5-8.5. When a range of two numbers is 
displayed, it represents the 25th to 75th 
percentiles of the distribution of results from 
individual climate models, unless noted 
otherwise. This means 25% of model results 
were below the given range, 50% were within it, 
and 25% were above it. Most variables with 
decades listed actually represent a 30-year 
average centered on that decade. For example, 
“2080s” is the average for 2070–2099. The use 
of 30-year averaging is a standard practice for 
projecting future climate conditions, as such 
conditions have natural year-to-year variability. 
Sea level projections are based on different 
methods and use 10-year averages.

The IPCC has not assigned likelihoods to the scenarios in Table 2-1, and scientists and policymakers continue 
to debate which of these trajectories seems most plausible. The projections methodology report4 provides a 
detailed rationale for focusing on SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 in the projections developed for this assessment. 
Among other factors, the methodology report notes that even if greenhouse gas emissions are likely to be 
lower than SSP5-8.5’s trajectory, retaining SSP5-8.5 can help to capture the broad range of plausible climate 
impacts, including high-consequence impacts that are critical for risk management. The full data set allows 
users to explore scenario-specific results and differences between scenarios for average temperature and 
precipitation.

More information about the SSPs from a New York State perspective can be found in “Population Projections 
for New York State,” an analysis that will be published with the full assessment results. It presents detailed 
projections of the future population in New York, derived from the SSPs and the plausible future changes in 
population and development that they represent. This exploration of the state’s future demographics and 
settlement patterns (for example, population growth near the coast) offers context for assessing the impacts 
of concurrent changes in climate hazards. 
Box 2  Comparing scenarios 
The modeled results from two scenarios have been combined in many places to provide a single range of 
potential outcomes, which some users may find more useful than multiple sets of numbers. However, it is 
still important to recognize that no one emissions scenario has been “locked in.” The very reason for 
modeling multiple scenarios is that there are several paths the world could take. If the world takes serious 
action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and control future warming, the resulting impacts could be 
closer to the low end of the projected range, or perhaps even lower. 
Figure 2-2 provides an example of how the two main scenarios analyzed for this assessment diverge over 
time. This example shows ensemble averages (that is, averages of all climate models) for the intermediate 
and very high emissions scenarios for one assessment region—North Hudson—and one variable, annual 
average temperature. Other variables show a similar divergence, as most are fundamentally based on 
temperature.

Additional information about the climate projections developed for this assessment, including sources of 
baseline data and a comparison with projections used in New York’s 2011 and 2014 ClimAID assessments, can 
be found in the projections methodology report.4 
Some weather and climate phenomena and resulting impacts are too complex or too dependent on other 
influencing factors to model reliably with current technologies. In such cases, the assessment presents the 
best available qualitative information and acknowledges the lack of robust modeling.

Temperature  
3.1 Average Temperature 
Average temperature is a fundamental attribute of climatology. Here, the concept refers to daily average air 
temperatures near ground level, averaged over an entire year. This measure naturally obscures day-to-day 
and seasonal variations, and it does not characterize the extreme ends of the temperature distribution, which 
are responsible for many of the most severe impacts discussed throughout this assessment’s sector chapters. 
Nonetheless, changes in average temperature provide a simple indication of how the temperature distribution 
is shifting over time, as represented by the center of the distribution. 
3.1.1 Historical Observations 
Based on data from 1981 to 2010, annual average temperatures range from 40.7°F in the Adirondacks to 
55.2°F in New York City.3 Although the southern part of the state is the warmest on average, summer 
temperatures along the immediate shoreline are moderated by sea breezes.4 
From 1901 to 2022, average temperatures in New York State increased by almost 2.6°F, and the warmest 10-
year periods in recorded history have occurred since 2000 (Figure 2-3).13 Among the 27 long-term weather 
stations that this assessment used for downscaling projections, all experienced warming, and 24 had warming 
trends that were statistically significant to a 99% confidence level over the 1901–2020 time period.4 As a 
whole, New York State warmed at an average rate of approximately 0.21°F per decade from 1901 to 2022, 
significant at the 99% level.14 This rate of warming is higher than the contiguous 48 states’ average rate of 
0.17°F per decade over the same time frame.14 These long-term average rates of change are based on 
ordinary least-squares linear regression from 1901 to 2022. Additional statistical testing of the data in Figure 
2-3 shows that the warming in New York State has occurred at a faster rate over the last 40 years (1983–
2022) than over the full time series (1901–2022).4

the entire year, calculated for each NOAA climate division as part of NOAA’s nClimDiv data set, and then averaged across 
all of New York’s climate divisions, weighted by each division’s area. The black line shows the ordinary least-squares 
linear trend (+0.21°F per decade), which is significant to a 99% confidence level (p < 0.001). Data from NOAA (2023).14 
3.1.2 Projections of Future Change 
Annual average temperatures are projected to increase in all regions of New York progressively throughout the 
21st century (Figure 2-4). Across the state, annual average temperatures are projected to increase by 2.5–
4.4°F by the 2030s, 3.8–6.7°F by the 2050s, and 5.1–10.9°F by the 2080s, depending on global greenhouse 
gas emission rates.3 
Regionally, the largest changes are projected for the St. Lawrence Valley, Champlain Valley, Adirondacks, and 
Great Lakes assessment regions, with annual average temperatures projected to increase by 4.6°F to 6.7°F by 
the 2050s and 6.1°F to 10.9°F by the 2080s, compared with the 1981–2010 baselines. New York City is 
projected to remain the warmest part of the state, reaching an annual average temperature of 59.2–61.2°F by 
the 2050s and 60.8–65.0°F by the 2080s—about 6 to 10 degrees warmer than it was from 1981 to 2010.3 This 
means New York City’s average temperature by the 2080s is projected to be on par with the 20th century 
average for Birmingham, Alabama (about 63°F).14 (This comparison applies to average annual temperature 
only, and does not imply that other climate metrics, such as seasonal average temperature, daily temperature 
extremes, or precipitation, would change to the same degree.) The Adirondacks are projected to remain New 
York’s coldest region, although annual average temperature is projected to increase from 40.7°F during the 
1981–2010 baseline period to 45.3–47.3°F by the 2050s and 46.8–51.3°F by the 2080s.3

(50th percentile) modeled results from a blend of the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Data 
from projections developed for this assessment.3  
3.2 Seasonal Temperature 
New York experiences drastic seasonal changes in temperature. This seasonality is central to many of the 
rhythms of life across the state, from agricultural production to energy use to traditional seasonal recreational 
activities and the local economies that depend on them. It also creates the conditions in which New York’s 
many varied ecosystems thrive. Thus, seasonal average temperature—daily mean temperatures averaged over 
an entire season—can provide a useful indication of how climate change might affect processes that depend 
on the temperature at a particular time of year, such as frozen conditions in winter. Analyzing seasonal 
average temperatures can also reveal whether certain seasons are changing more rapidly than others.  
3.2.1 Historical Observations 
Winter is New York’s coldest season, with an average daily temperature from 1901 to 2022 of 22.2°F (Figure 
2-5). Summer (June–August) is the warmest season, with an average temperature of 66.1°F over the same 
period. Fall (September–November) and spring (March–May) lie between these extremes, with average 
temperatures of 48.1°F and 42.9°F, respectively, over the period 1901–2022. 
National and regional analyses consistently show that winter is warming more rapidly than any other season 
across the contiguous 48 states,15 particularly in the Northeast,16 and New York follows suit. The state’s 
winters have warmed at a rate almost double that of spring and fall, and more than double that of summer 
(Figure 2-5). Over the period 1901–2022, winter average temperatures increased at an average rate of 0.34°F 
per decade, compared with 0.18°F in spring, 0.15°F in summer, and 0.18°F in fall (Figure 2-5). As with annual 
average temperatures in section 3.1.1, the seasonal trends reported here are based on linear regression slopes 
over the full period of record.

Figure 2-5. Seasonal average temperatures in New York State, 1901–2022. Daily mean air temperatures are averaged 
over each season, calculated for each NOAA climate division as part of NOAA’s nClimDiv data set, and then averaged 
across all of New York’s climate divisions, weighted by each division’s area. Seasons are defined meteorologically: spring 
is March–May, summer is June–August, fall is September–November, and winter is December–February (plotted here at 
the year when the winter season ended; for example, December 2021–February 2022 is plotted as 2022). Ordinary least-
squares linear trends are shown as black lines for reference; winter (+0.34°F per decade, p < 0.001), spring (+0.28°F 
per decade, p = 0.001), summer (+0.15°F per decade, p < 0.001), and fall (+0.18°F per decade, p < 0.001) changes are 
statistically significant to a 99% confidence level. Data from NOAA (2023).14 
3.2.2 Projections of Future Change 
Average seasonal temperatures are projected to increase across all regions of New York, compared with the 
1981–2010 baseline (Table 2-2). Winter temperatures are projected to increase the most.

3.3 Extreme Heat and Heat Waves 
Very hot days occur as a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. However, evidence worldwide shows 
that temperatures are more frequently exceeding thresholds historically considered to be “unusual” or 
“extreme.”1 This phenomenon occurs as warming shifts the entire distribution of temperatures, pushing more 
daily temperatures beyond thresholds once considered rare. Extreme heat can pose risks for human health, 
built infrastructure, agriculture, ecosystems, and more, as this assessment’s sector chapters explore in detail. 
Extremes can pose particular danger when they persist for several days—a phenomenon known as a heat 
wave or extreme heat event.  
Meteorologists and climate scientists use a variety of definitions and thresholds to identify and characterize 
unusually hot days and heat waves. These definitions often refer to the historical occurrence of such events at 
a particular location as a baseline, which means that the temperature threshold for “extreme” can vary from 
one location to another, even within the same state. For this assessment, unless noted otherwise, a “heat 
wave” is defined as three or more consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 90°F. 
3.3.1 Historical Observations 
Days over 90°F are not uncommon in New York City, which is located in 
the southern part of the state and where the urban heat island effect 
(defined in the box to the right) exacerbates high temperatures. From 
1981 to 2010, the weather station at Central Park recorded an average 
of 17 days per year over 90°F, an average of four days per year over 
95°F, and an average of two heat waves per year. In contrast, days 
hotter than 90°F are fairly uncommon in the northern part of the state. 
For example, from 1981 to 2010, Lake Placid experienced an average of 
only 1 day a year above 90°F, no days above 95°F, and an average of 
one heat wave every 10 years.3  
In some parts of New York State, temperatures occasionally exceed 100°F. In Albany, the highest daily 
temperature ever recorded was 104°F in 1911.18 The hottest daily temperatures recorded in Central Park and 
in Rochester occurred on the same day in 1936, when temperatures reached 106°F and 102°F, 
respectively.19,20 Other cities around the state have yet to exceed 100 degrees: The hottest temperature ever 
recorded in Buffalo was 99°F in 1948.21 
Most of the 19 weather stations that were the focus of this assessment have records dating back to at least 
the first half of the 20th century. Considering the full period of record available for each station and using the 
definition of a heat wave as three or more consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 90°F, 
most of the stations have not yet experienced a statistically significant change in the number of heat waves 
per year (based on first-order screening via ordinary least-squares linear regression and looking for 
significance to a 95% confidence level). However, Central Park—the station with the longest record, dating 
back to 1869—has experienced a significant increase. There, the number of heat waves per year averaged 1.3 
from 1869 to 1900, 1.8 from 1901 to 1950, 2.3 from 1951 to 2000, and 2.4 from 2001 to 2022.22 
An EPA analysis of heat waves in 50 large metropolitan areas nationwide over the 1961 to 2021 period using a 
different definition of “heat wave” found that heat wave frequency increased significantly (to at least a 95% 
level) in both Albany and Buffalo.23 Heat wave duration and the length of heat wave season also increased 
significantly in Albany over the same period.23 This analysis found no significant change in heat wave 
characteristics in Rochester over the 1961–2021 period. It excluded New York City because of inconsistency in 
Urban heat islands are urbanized 
areas that experience higher 
temperatures than outlying areas 
because the built environment 
(buildings, roads, and other 
infrastructure) absorbs and re-
emits the sun’s heat more than 
natural landscapes such as 
forests and water bodies.17

available data. This particular analysis defined a heat wave as two or more consecutive days when the daily 
minimum apparent temperature (the actual temperature adjusted for humidity) in a particular city exceeded 
the 85th percentile of historical July and August temperatures. The emphasis on daily minimum temperature 
reflects the importance of nighttime warming, which poses a particular danger to people without access to 
cooling, as hot nights prevent the body from recovering from hot daytime conditions.13,24 Additional analysis of 
data across New York State indicates that summer nights are becoming warmer, with more very warm nights 
(those with a minimum temperature of 70°F or higher) in 2010–2014 than in any prior five-year period dating 
back to 1900.13 In Central Park, five of the hottest 10 minimum temperatures ever recorded have occurred 
during the 21st century.25 These findings are consistent with analyses of single-day minimum and maximum 
temperatures over the entire contiguous United States, which have shown that lows (typically nighttime 
temperatures) have warmed much more rapidly than daytime highs, especially since around 2000.26  
3.3.2 Projections of Future Change 
The number of days above 90°F is projected to increase across New York State during the 21st century 
(Figure 2-7). At the 19 weather stations with enough data to calculate changes in extreme events for this 
assessment, the average number of days per year over 90°F ranged from 1 (Lake Placid) to 18 (Dobbs Ferry) 
during the 1981–2010 baseline period. These two stations are projected to continue to have the least and the 
most days above 90°F, respectively, in the future. Lake Placid is projected to experience 6 to 16 days per year 
above 90°F by the 2050s and 12 to 45 days by the 2080s. Dobbs Ferry is projected to have 41 to 64 days per 
year above 90°F by the 2050s and 48 to 87 days by the 2080s. Dobbs Ferry and Saratoga Springs are 
expected to experience the largest increases.3 
 
Figure 2-7. Historical and projected future number of days per year over 90°F in New York State. Columns show the 
median (50th percentile) modeled results from a blend of the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas emissions 
scenarios, while the thinner lines show the 25th–75th percentile range from this same two-scenario blend. Data from 
projections developed for this assessment.3 
The number of days over 95°F is also projected to increase across New York State. Dobbs Ferry and Central 
Park are projected to experience the most 95°F days: 13 to 29 days per year by the 2050s and 18 to 57 by the 
2080s for Dobbs Ferry, and 14 to 32 days by the 2050s and 17 to 54 days by the 2080s for Central Park. Lake 
Placid, the coldest station considered in this analysis, had no days over 95°F during the baseline period but 
can expect 1 to 3 days per year by the 2050s and 2 to 16 days per year by the 2080s.3  
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
16 
Multiday heat waves are expected to occur more frequently across New York State in the decades ahead 
(Figure 2-8). By the 2080s, all stations are projected to have at least three heat waves each year. Central Park 
and Dobbs Ferry, which had the most heat waves per year over the 1981–2010 baseline period at an average 
of 2 per year, are anticipated to experience 5 to 9 heat waves per year by the 2050s and 6 to 10 by the 2080s. 
Saratoga Springs is projected to experience the largest increase in number of heat waves.3  
In addition to becoming more frequent, heat waves are also projected to last longer. From 1981 to 2010, heat 
waves in Central Park, Dobbs Ferry, and Saratoga Springs lasted an average of four days. All three locations 
are projected to experience heat waves lasting five to eight days, on average, by the 2080s. Other locations 
throughout the state are also projected to experience longer heat waves.3

three or more consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 90°F. Columns show the median (50th 
percentile) modeled results from a blend of the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, while the 
thinner lines show the 25th–75th percentile range from this same two-scenario blend. Instances with no thin gray line 
protruding above and/or below the top of the shaded column indicate that the 25th and/or 75th percentile values are 
equal to the median value. Data from projections developed for this assessment.3 
3.4 Heat Index 
The human health risks of extreme heat increase when combined with other weather conditions such as high 
humidity. When humidity is high, the body’s natural cooling mechanism—sweating—becomes less effective as 
sweat evaporates more slowly. New York has a relatively humid climate, like the Eastern United States in 
general. Thus, it is particularly important for an assessment of climate impacts in New York to consider the 
additive effect of humidity when examining the danger posed by extreme heat. 
Meteorologists characterize the combined stress of temperature and other factors in a few different ways. Two 
commonly used approaches are: 
 Heat index: A calculation that combines temperature and relative humidity to report an “apparent 
temperature.” Heat index values assume shady locations, which means the apparent temperature could 
feel hotter in direct sunlight. The National Weather Service urges “extreme caution” with heat index 
values above 90°F, and it classifies values above 103°F as “dangerous” and values above 125°F as 
“extremely dangerous.” A heat index below the “extreme caution” level can still be dangerous, as 
studies have found statistically significant increases in adverse health effects when the daily maximum 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
17 
heat index is between 76°F and 90°F, including excess cardiovascular hospitalizations, heat stress, 
dehydration, and kidney failure.27,28  
 Wet-bulb globe temperature: A measure of heat stress in direct sunlight that considers 
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sun angle and cloud cover (solar radiation). One component of 
this measurement is the wet-bulb temperature, which is the temperature read by a thermometer 
covered in a wet cloth. 
Wet-bulb globe temperature has gained increasing use as an arguably better representation of the heat stress 
felt by the human body. However, it requires more information than heat index to compute. This assessment 
focuses on heat index because global climate models can project temperature and relative humidity, whereas 
the models are less able to project wind speed and cloud cover with confidence. The assessment examines 
heat index values starting at 85°F in light of the observed health effects described above. 
3.4.1 Historical Observations 
The occurrence of high heat index values has varied substantially by region in New York State, historically. 
New York City has typically experienced the most days with high heat index values: an average of 38 days per 
year with a heat index above 85°F and 6 days per year above 95°F, as measured at Central Park during the 
1981–2010 baseline period.3 During that period, the maximum annual heat index value was 101°F, on 
average. Another study examined the average daily heat index from 1997 to 2006 at LaGuardia Airport, with 
an average daily maximum of 80.4 +/- 10°F for May through September, 87°F for July, and 86°F for August.29 
In contrast, Lake Placid experienced an average of only two days per year with a heat index above 85°F 
during the 1981–2010 period, and no days above 95°F.3  
During heat waves, many regions of New York State, particularly cities, can exceed the “extreme caution” heat 
index threshold of 90°F, and sometimes even the “dangerous” threshold of 103°F. In July 2001, for example, 
Rochester achieved a record high heat index of 117°F even though the air temperature was only 94°F.30 
3.4.2 Projections of Future Change 
The number of days with a heat index greater than 85°F, the number of days with a heat index greater than 
95°F, and the maximum heat index are expected to increase substantially across all regions of New York 
State.4 
By the 2050s, the warmest location modeled, Central Park, is projected to experience 74 to 93 days per year 
with a heat index above 85°F and 30 to 46 days above 95°F.3 By the 2080s, those numbers increase to 89 to 
118 days above 85°F and 39 to 77 days above 95°F.3 This is the largest change across all stations modeled. 
Other cities projected to experience large increases in the number of high heat index days include Albany, 
Buffalo, and Rochester. The coldest location modeled, Lake Placid, can expect 22 to 53 days per year with a 
heat index above 85°F by the 2080s—compared with a historical baseline of 2 days per year—and 2 to 15 
days above 95°F, versus a baseline of 0 days per year.3 
Projections also show the annual maximum heat index increasing over time throughout New York (Figure 
2-9).3 During the 1981–2010 baseline period, all locations had a typical annual maximum heat index value 
below the 103°F “dangerous” threshold, although Central Park and Dobbs Ferry were close at 101°F and 
100°F, respectively. By the 2050s, the projected range is at or above 103°F for all but three stations—and all 
but Lake Placid are at least 102°F. The 2080s are projected to be even warmer. Central Park and Dobbs Ferry 
are both projected to experience maximum heat index values between 115°F and 130°F—a range 
encompassing heat index values classified as “extremely dangerous.” All stations are projected to experience 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2

at least a 12°F increase in the maximum heat index by the 2080s, compared with the 1981–2010 baseline. 
Oswego is projected to experience the largest change.3

3.5 Extreme Cold 
Like extremely hot days, extremely cold days also occur as a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. 
Extremely cold weather can pose a danger to the health of people who are unprepared and exposed, and it 
can also damage infrastructure.31 What is considered “extreme cold” varies regionally, as temperatures below 
0°F are common during winter in some parts of New York but quite rare in others. Climate change is generally 
expected to lead to less frequent and less extreme cold spells as temperatures warm worldwide.1  
3.5.1 Historical Observations 
Temperatures in New York can drop to negative double digits during winter cold spells. The state’s record low 
temperature of -52°F occurred in the Adirondacks, at Stillwater Reservoir in 1934 and Old Forge in 1979.32 
Albany, Buffalo, and Rochester have all experienced record lows of -20°F or below.20,21,18 Looking at broader 
patterns, Lake Placid averaged 33 days per year with a minimum temperature below 0°F during the period 
1981–2010, and Watertown averaged 21.3 Sub-zero temperatures have occurred less frequently elsewhere—
an average of 6 days per year in Binghamton, 3 in Buffalo, and 0.2 days (one day every five years) at Central 
Park from 1981 to 2010. Over the longer record from 1900 to 2021, Central Park experienced 37 days with a 
minimum temperature at or below 0°F, but only 9 of those days occurred within the past 60 years.4 
A review of historical data shows that winter nights are becoming warmer across New York State, with very 
cold nights (i.e., nights with a temperature below 0°F) occurring less frequently since 1990, compared with 
most of the 20th century.13 
3.5.2 Projections of Future Change 
The annual number of days below 0°F and days below 32°F are projected to decrease across the state (Figure 
2-10). At Lake Placid, the coldest location included in these projections, the change will be substantial: a 
projection of only 9 to 15 days per year below 0°F in the 2050s, and 2 to 11 in the 2080s, compared with 33 
during the 1981–2010 baseline period. Lake Placid is also projected to lose 39 to 68 days per year below the 
freezing point (32°F) by the 2080s. At the other end of the spectrum, Central Park, the location with the 
fewest cold extremes, is also projected to experience fewer very cold days. By the 2050s, Central Park is 
projected to experience no days below 0°F and 31 to 48 days per year below 32°F, compared with a baseline 
of 70. By the 2080s, Central Park is projected to experience only 9 to 39 days per year below 32°F.

Figure 2-10. Historical and projected future number of days below 32°F and 0°F in New York State. Columns show the 
median (50th percentile) modeled results from a blend of the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas emissions 
scenarios, while the thinner lines show the 25th–75th percentile range from this same two-scenario blend. Data from 
projections developed for this assessment.3 
The loss of days below freezing is particularly concerning, as frozen conditions influence animal migration, 
control the activity and proliferation of pests (e.g., ticks), and affect hydrological cycles, the growing season, 
and more generally whether precipitation falls as rain or snow. The latter is of great importance to winter 
recreation and the local economies that depend on it. By the 2080s, the locations modeled for this assessment 
are projected to lose between 31 (Central Park) and 96 (Oswego) days per year below 32°F relative to the 
1981–2010 baseline.3 This change essentially represents the frozen season shrinking by one to three months. 
Some research has suggested that extreme cold air outbreaks connected with the polar vortex, a large area of 
low pressure that is typically centered on the North Pole, could become more common in places like the 
northeastern United States as the Arctic warms.33,34 However, more recent research suggests that extreme 
cold associated with polar vortex events is unlikely to increase, as detailed in the projections methodology 
report.4

3.6 Heating and Cooling Degree Days 
Changes in outdoor temperature will influence the amount of energy that New Yorkers use to heat or cool 
their homes and other buildings. This relationship is commonly examined using the concept of “degree days.” 
Heating degree days and cooling degree days are computed by taking each day’s daily average temperature 
and calculating how far it is below or above a common reference point of 65°F, respectively. Heating degree 
days are used to estimate energy requirements for heating, whereas cooling degree days are used to estimate 
energy requirements for air conditioning. 
3.6.1 Historical Observations 
With annual average temperatures well below 65°F throughout the state, New York experiences substantially 
more heating degree days than cooling degree days each year. From 1895 to 2022, New York experienced a 
long-term average of 6429 heating degree days and 507 cooling degree days per year (Figure 2-11). An 
ordinary least-squares linear regression over the entire period of record indicates that heating degree days 
have decreased at a rate of about 8 degree days per year, and cooling degree days have increased at about 2 
degree days per year; both results are significant to a 99% confidence level.14 Figure 2-11 suggests that much 
of the change has been concentrated in the past few decades. 
 
Figure 2-11. Heating and cooling degree days in New York State, 1895–2022. Daily mean temperatures and annual 
degree days were calculated for each NOAA climate division as part of NOAA’s nClimDiv data set, then averaged across all 
of New York’s climate divisions, weighted by each division’s population. With this approach, state heating degree day and 
cooling degree day numbers more closely reflect the conditions that the average resident of the state would experience. 
Ordinary least-squares linear trends are shown as black lines for reference; heating degree days (-7.7 degree days per 
year, p < 0.001), and cooling degree days (+2.0 degree days per year, p < 0.001) both have trends significant to a 99% 
confidence level. Data from NOAA (2023).14

22 
3.6.2 Projections of Future Change 
The projections developed for this assessment show agreement across all climate models that heating degree 
days will decrease in New York over the course of the 21st century, and cooling degree days will increase. The 
direction of change is consistent for all 19 long-term weather stations that had sufficient data to downscale 
degree-day projections. The range of results across all 19 stations suggests that New Yorkers will experience 
1229 to 3026 fewer heating degree days in the 2080s compared with the 1981–2010 baseline, a 22% to 41% 
decrease. Conversely, New Yorkers are projected to experience 377 to 1626 more cooling degree days in the 
2080s compared with the 1981–2010 baseline, a 69% to 528% increase. (Each of the statewide ranges given 
here comprises the 25th percentile from the location with the least change and the 75th percentile from the 
location with the most change.) Figure 2-12 shows projections by decade for six locations in different parts of 
the state.

Precipitation 
4.1 Total Annual Precipitation 
Rain and snow are vital to sustaining life in New York. New York is fortunate to be generally “water rich,”35 but 
there are still many human and ecological needs competing for water. Total annual precipitation—inches of 
rain plus snow converted to its liquid equivalent—offers a broad look at the amount of water available to meet 
these needs. Tracking and modeling total precipitation can also reveal the potential for excess moisture and its 
associated challenges, such as flooding. At a global scale, climate change will increase total precipitation as 
warming accelerates the water cycle, increasing evaporation that then leads to more precipitation. However, 
the shifting weather patterns associated with climate change will spread the additional precipitation unevenly, 
causing some parts of the world to receive less precipitation than they did in the past, while others receive 
substantially more. The northeastern United States is among the regions widely expected to receive more 
precipitation overall as the Earth warms.1 
4.1.1 Historical Observations 
From 1901 to 2022, New York received an average of 41.1 inches of precipitation per year statewide.14 Totals 
vary regionally. New York’s wettest areas are those downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario and those near 
the coast. These areas received an average of approximately 46 inches per year over the baseline period 
1981–2010. The west-central part of the state is relatively drier, receiving 35 inches per year on average over 
the baseline period 1981–2010.4  
Annual precipitation across New York State increased at a rate of 0.47 inches per decade from 1901 to 2022 
(Figure 2-13). This change mirrors the trend across the entire northeastern United States over the same 
period, which was 0.46 inches per decade.14 The increase in New York is statistically significant to a 99% 
confidence level.4 Total change has amounted to 10% to 20% since 1901.36

Figure 2-13. Annual total precipitation in New York State, 1901–2022. The graph shows daily precipitation summed over 
the entire year, calculated for each NOAA climate division as part of NOAA’s nClimDiv data set, and then averaged across 
all of New York’s climate divisions, weighted by each division’s area. The black line shows the ordinary least-squares 
linear trend (+0.47 inches per decade), which is significant to a 99% confidence level (p < 0.001). Data from NOAA 
(2023).14 
Of the 27 long-term weather stations used for this assessment, 19 stations experienced increases in annual 
precipitation from 1901 to 2020 that were significant at the 95% level; 15 of these increases were also 
significant at the 99% level. Trends range from an increase of 1.03 inches per decade observed at Oswego to 
a decline of 0.16 inches per decade (though not statistically significant) at Setauket on Long Island.4 Year-to-
year variation in annual precipitation has also become more pronounced, as evidenced by increases in the 
standard deviation of annual precipitation at 24 out of 27 stations.4 
4.1.2 Projections of Future Change 
Annual precipitation is projected to increase progressively in all New York State climate regions through the 
late 21st century (Figure 2-14). Across the state, precipitation is projected to increase by approximately 1% to 
8% by the 2030s, 2% to 12% by the 2050s, and 6% to 17% by the 2080s, relative to a 1981–2010 baseline.3  
The largest percentage increases in annual precipitation are projected for the New York City, Catskills, and 
South Hudson assessment regions.3 For example, annual precipitation in New York City is projected to increase 
by 4% to 11% by the 2050s and by 7% to 17% by the 2080s, relative to the 1981–2010 baseline of 49.9 
inches per year.3 New York City will continue to be the wettest assessment region, and the Central/Finger 
Lakes region will continue to be the driest.

greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Data from projections developed for this assessment.3 
4.2 Seasonal Precipitation 
The importance of precipitation as a climate variable is a matter of not just how much precipitation falls, but 
also when it falls. The timing of precipitation has critical implications for water availability to support base 
streamflow and human uses throughout the year. Precipitation in specific seasons is critical to certain sectors 
of the economy, such as agriculture and winter recreation. Too much precipitation in a particular season can 
contribute to flooding, saturated farm fields that inhibit planting,37 and other challenges. 
4.2.1 Historical Observations 
Precipitation in New York State is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with an average of 8.63 inches 
in winter, 10.02 inches in spring, 11.59 inches in summer, and 10.79 inches in fall over the 1901–2022 period 
(Figure 2-15).14 Precipitation in inland New York typically peaks in intensity in the summer, while coastal areas 
tend to receive the most precipitation during the late spring and early fall.38 
Precipitation in New York has increased in some seasons since the early 20th century. From 1901 to 2022, fall 
precipitation increased the most, at a rate of 0.22 inches per decade.14 Summer precipitation increased at a 
rate of 0.13 inches per decade.14 These long-term average rates of change are based on ordinary least-
squares linear regression, and both are significant to a 95% confidence level. Winter and spring precipitation 
did not change significantly.14

Figure 2-15. Total precipitation by season in New York State, 1901–2022. Daily precipitation has been summed over 
each season, calculated for each NOAA climate division as part of NOAA’s nClimDiv data set, and then averaged across all 
of New York’s climate divisions, weighted by each division’s area. Seasons are defined meteorologically: spring is March–
May, summer is June–August, fall is September–November, and winter is December–February (plotted here at the year 
when the winter season ended; for example, December 2021–February 2022 is plotted as 2022). Ordinary least-squares 
linear trends are shown as black lines for reference; summer (+0.13 inches per decade, p = 0.022) and fall (+0.22 inches 
per decade, p < 0.001) changes are statistically significant to a 95% confidence level, while winter and spring are not. 
Data from NOAA (2023).14 
4.2.2 Projections of Future Change 
Precipitation is expected to increase in winter and spring across all of New York’s climate regions throughout 
the 21st century (Figure 2-16). This finding is consistent with previous climate projections for New York.39 
Future trends in summer and fall precipitation are less clear. 
Total winter precipitation is projected to increase 5% to 21% by the 2050s and 11% to 31% by the 2080s, 
compared with the 1981–2010 baseline. Spring precipitation is projected to increase 3% to 17% by the 2050s 
and 6% to 23% by the 2080s. The wide ranges listed here cover from the 25th percentile of the lowest 
assessment region to the 75th percentile of the highest region. All regions of the state are projected to 
experience an increase in both winter and spring, and the projected percentage changes through the 2080s 
are fairly comparable across regions, with no large regional differences or outliers.3  
Projections of summer and fall precipitation are less definitive, with some climate models projecting an 
increase in precipitation and some projecting a decline throughout the 21st century. Across assessment 
regions, total precipitation in summer is projected to change between -7% and 12% by the 2050s, and -7% to 
20% by the 2080s. Precipitation in fall is projected to change -5% to 10% by the 2050s, and -2% to 14% by 
the 2080s.3

4.3 Heavy Precipitation 
Heavy precipitation refers to a large amount of rain or snow falling during a short period of time, such as a 
single day or even a single hour. Heavy precipitation events can lead to devastating flooding and damage to 
infrastructure and ecosystems as excess water overwhelms the ability of the natural landscape and the built 
environment to absorb it or carry it away. 
Increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation have been observed worldwide and attributed 
to human-induced climate change.1 This observation is consistent with the expectation that warmer air, 
warmer bodies of water, and increased evaporation will contribute to the formation of more intense storms. 
This trend is expected to continue.1 
Meteorologists and climatologists characterize heavy precipitation in various ways for different needs, including 
different time frames and different types of thresholds: fixed (precipitation exceeding a certain number of 
inches) or probabilistic (return period or likelihood of occurrence based on the historical record, reflecting 
locational differences in what is considered “extreme”). The team for this assessment developed projections of 
heavy precipitation with respect to three fixed thresholds over a one-day period: days with more than 1, 2, 
and 4 inches of precipitation. 
4.3.1 Historical Observations 
According to the Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC), the frequency of 2-inch precipitation events has 
increased since the 1950s across New York and New England.40 New York has experienced an above average 
number of 2-inch precipitation events since 1995, with the frequency of 2-inch precipitation events peaking 
from 2010 to 2014.39 Across New York and New England, storms previously considered once in 100-year 
events (an event with a 1% chance of occurring in any given year) are also becoming more frequent, 
occurring nearly twice as often as expected in recent years.40 What constitutes a 100-year event ranges from a 
4- to 5.5-inch storm in Northern and Western New York to an 8-inch storm in New York City and on Long 
Island.40 
Several of the weather stations examined elsewhere in this assessment had sufficient data to analyze whether 
the annual number of heavy precipitation events has changed over time. These weather stations had 
precipitation data as early as 1869 for Central Park, 1894 for Elmira, and the 1920s to 1950s for the other 
sites. Seven of the nine weather stations statistically analyzed had significant long-term increases in the 
number of days per year with precipitation greater than 1 inch (p < 0.05).12 Two of the nine weather stations 
statistically analyzed, Oswego and Central Park, had a significant increase over time in the number of days per 
year with precipitation greater than 2 inches (p < 0.05). None of the sites analyzed statistically had a 
significant long-term linear trend in the number of days per year with precipitation greater than 4 inches, 
which remains an exceedingly rare event (all p values were greater than 0.05).  
While extreme rainfall is more common in coastal parts of New York that are periodically affected by tropical 
storms and hurricanes, extreme rainfall is not exclusive to tropical cyclones. For example, the state’s 24-hour 
precipitation record (13.57 inches) was set at Islip, Long Island, during a non-tropical storm in August 2014.39 
Extreme events often drive interannual differences in annual precipitation. For example, the record for the 
most annual precipitation in New York State was set in 2011. Back-to-back extreme precipitation events 
caused by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee are recognized as drivers that led to the precipitation record 
being broken. Hurricane Irene, which occurred during late August 2011, delivered 7 inches of rain to Eastern 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
29 
New York and more than 18 inches at certain locations in the Catskills. Tropical Storm Lee, which occurred in 
early September, delivered more than 12 inches to the Susquehanna River basin.39 
Over the 1981–2010 baseline period used for this assessment’s modeling, the four weather stations closest to 
the coast (Bridgehampton, Central Park, Dobbs Ferry, and Mohonk Lake) each experienced an average of 14 
or 15 days per year with precipitation over 1 inch. All four stations also experienced three days per year with 
precipitation over 2 inches. Extreme precipitation events were much less frequent throughout the rest of the 
state, with stations averaging between 5 and 10 days per year with precipitation greater than 1 inch and 
between 0.3 and 1.0 days per year with precipitation greater than 2 inches. Most stations did not experience 
any precipitation events with more than 4 inches in one day during the baseline period. Bridgehampton 
experienced the most such events, at a rate of three every 10 years.3 
4.3.2 Projections of Future Change 
Days with more than 1 inch and days with more than 2 inches of precipitation (Figure 2-17) are projected to 
become more frequent at all 19 stations included in this analysis, based on the median results for the blended 
emissions scenarios used for this assessment.3 By the 2080s, days with more than 4 inches of precipitation are 
also projected to become more frequent at 12 of the 19 stations considered in this analysis.3 
 
Figure 2-17. Historical and projected future number of days per year with more than 2 inches of precipitation in New 
York State. The shaded bars show the median (50th percentile) modeled results from a blend of the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-
8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The gray bars show the range from the 25th to the 75th percentile modeled 
results. Instances with no thin gray line protruding above and/or below the top of the shaded column indicate that the 
25th and/or 75th percentile values are equal to the median value. Data from projections developed for this assessment.3 
From the 1981–2010 baseline to mid-century (2050s), the largest increases in 2-inch precipitation days are 
projected at Saratoga Springs, Bridgehampton, Central Park, Dobbs Ferry, and Mohonk Lake. Ten out of 19 
stations are projected to experience 4-inch precipitation days at least once per decade by the 2050s, 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
30 
increasing to 16 out of 19 stations by the 2080s. Bridgehampton and Mohonk Lake are projected to experience 
4-inch days five times per decade by the 2080s—roughly twice as often as during the baseline period.3  
4.4 Snowfall and Snow Cover  
Whether precipitation falls as rain or snow, and how long snow persists on the ground, matters for many 
reasons. Snow can pose challenges for infrastructure, mobility, and safety, yet it is also vital for many 
cherished winter activities and the local economies they sustain. Many types of ecosystems are adapted to 
winter snow cover, and the timing and amount of snowmelt at the end of the winter influence water 
availability and soil moisture later in the year. From a global perspective, snow reflects more sunlight back to 
space than bare ground or water, so an overall reduction in snow cover leads to more solar energy being 
absorbed by the Earth’s surface, which further increases warming. 
A warmer climate generally means that more winter precipitation could fall as rain instead of snow, and the 
snow that does fall will likely remain on the ground for less time as warmer air promotes more rapid melting. 
However, some areas could receive more snow if winter precipitation increases (section 4.2) while the 
temperature remains below freezing. This is particularly likely over the next few decades in parts of New York 
dominated by lake-effect snow, as section 4.4.2 describes. 
4.4.1 Historical Observations 
Snowfall varies considerably across New York State. Long Island and New York City have historically received 
the least snow, at about 30 inches per year, while annual totals immediately east of Lake Erie and Lake 
Ontario often reach or exceed 150 inches due to lake-effect storms.4 
Some changes in snowfall have been observed over time: 
 A review of annual snowfall totals from the 19 weather stations with long-term data used for this 
assessment found that four stations had a significant linear trend over their full period of record (p < 
0.05, indicating significance to a 95% confidence level).12 One—Lake Placid—has experienced a long-
term decrease in snowfall. The other three—Fredonia, Rochester, and Oswego—have experienced a 
long-term increase. The latter observation is generally consistent with a 2003 study that found an 
increase in lake-effect snowfall downwind from the Great Lakes since 1950.41 Three additional stations 
had results that were significant to a 95% level using one regression test but not another: Watertown 
(increase), Dannemora (decrease), and Central Park (decrease).12 
 An earlier analysis of data from 1930 to 2007 published by EPA found a long-term snowfall increase of 
0.5% per year in Buffalo and a mix of smaller changes (some increasing, some decreasing) at six other 
locations examined.42 This was a screening-level analysis that relied on linear regressions and did not 
report statistical significance. 
 The EPA report mentioned above also examined long-term trends in the snow-to-precipitation ratio, 
representing the proportion of total winter season precipitation that falls in the form of snow. Syracuse 
and Binghamton had statistically significant decreases in the snow-to-precipitation ratio from 1949 to 
2020 (trend via Kendall’s Tau method; significance to a 95% confidence level), while 10 other stations 
across New York did not have a statistically significant change.42 
In terms of snow depth, several of the weather stations used elsewhere in this assessment had sufficient data 
to analyze whether maximum annual snow depth has changed over time, dating back to 1913 for Central Park 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
31 
and as early as the 1920s for other sites. There has been much year-to-year variability, however, and none of 
the sites analyzed statistically had a significant long-term linear trend (all p values were greater than 0.2).12 
Additional observations point to a broader regional pattern of declining snow cover (areal extent) and 
snowpack (seasonal accumulation): 
 Some of the best long-term data on snow conditions in the Northeast come from the Hubbard Brook 
Ecosystem Study, a long-running research program at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the 
White Mountains of New Hampshire. Hubbard Brook has experienced statistically significant declines in 
days of snow cover, snow depth, and the amount of water held in the snowpack since the mid-1950s.43 
 Daily satellite imagery of the extent of the globe covered by snow shows that snow cover in North 
America (excluding Greenland) has held steady in winter but declined substantially during spring from 
1972 to 2020.44 During this time, the portion of the year when snow covered the ground decreased by 
an average of nearly two weeks across the United States.44 
 At five stream gauging sites in the Catskills region, the timing of peak snowmelt (as measured by the 
winter-spring center of volume) shifted earlier by 5 to 10 days between 1940 and 2018.45 
The New York State Mesonet, coordinated by the University at Albany, includes a Snow Network with 20 
monitoring stations, largely in the Adirondacks, the Catskills, and the Tug Hill region.46 Snowpack in these 
regions supports winter recreation, streamflow, and drinking water supplies (particularly in the Catskills, where 
snowmelt feeds the water supplies for New York City and Philadelphia). Each station has automated 
equipment that measures and reports snow depth at five-minute intervals and snow water equivalent at six-
hour intervals.46 Mesonet stations began to come online in 2015, so they have not yet collected enough years 
of data to reveal climatologically meaningful trends in snowpack depth or persistence. Nonetheless, continued 
monitoring will provide important data to characterize changes in snow accumulation in the future. Further 
analysis could also consider longer-term snow depth data collected at two-week intervals by the New York 
State Cooperative Snow Survey.47 
4.4.2 Projections of Future Change 
Snowfall, depth, extent, and water equivalent are projected to decrease across New York State.16 The snow 
season is projected to become compressed, with more precipitation falling as rain, including some lake-effect 
precipitation.48 
Using two CMIP5 models, a 2015 study48 produced dynamically downscaled projections of snow across the 
Great Lakes basin under the very high emissions scenario (at the time, denoted as RCP8.5). They projected 
that by 2080–2099, parts of New York mapped in their study will lose 20 to 67 inches (50 to 170 centimeters) 
in annual snowfall and 10 to 25 days per year with snowfall, compared with the period 1980–1999.48 
Models suggest that over the next few decades, warmer water and decreased ice cover on the Great Lakes are 
likely to increase lake-effect snow.49 As the state continues to warm, however, the additional precipitation 
caused by warmer lake conditions will increasingly fall as rain rather than snow.49 This projection is consistent 
with modeling indicating a reduction in the frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms throughout most of the 
Great Lakes basin by the late 21st century.48

Extreme Events 
This section presents information about various types of severe storms, storm surge, drought, and wildfires. 
Other types of extreme events are covered elsewhere in this chapter, including temperature extremes 
(sections 3.3 and 3.4), heavy precipitation events (section 4.3), coastal and inland flooding (sections 6.2 and 
7.3), and seiches (section 7.5). 
5.1 Severe Storms 
New York has suffered several memorably destructive storms in recent years, including Hurricane Irene and 
Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the remnants of Hurricane Ida in 2021, and the 
historic snowstorms that hit Western New York in November and December 2022. These examples illustrate 
several of the types of major storms that can occur in New York, which include: 
 Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and tropical storms), which generally occur between July and October and 
can bring heavy precipitation, high winds, and coastal storm surge as the wind pushes water toward the 
shore.50 
 Extratropical cyclones (including nor’easters), which tend to occur during cooler months and can bring 
high winds, heavy rain or snow, flooding, and wave action along the shore that can persist through 
several tide cycles.50 Nor’easters present a range of risks to the state, but particularly to coastal areas, 
including extremely heavy precipitation (inland flooding), strong winds, and coastal erosion and storm-
surge associated flooding. In addition, nor’easters are often followed by intense cold and damaging 
winds as storm systems exit the region to the northeast. 
 Other heavy snow and ice storms, including storms strengthened by the lake effect over Lakes Erie and 
Ontario. 
 Thunderstorms. 
 Tornadoes, derechos (intense windstorms), and other events that are rarer in New York than the other 
types of storms listed above but do occur on occasion.  
5.1.1 Historical Observations 
Between 1851 and 2022, 15 cyclones hit New York at hurricane strength,51 plus many more at tropical storm 
strength. The state has also experienced frequent nor’easters, lake-effect blizzards, and other storms. Coastal 
flooding in New York has historically been caused by storm surge associated with tropical and extratropical 
cyclones, with peak historical storm surges recorded in the years 1788, 1821, 1960, and 2012.52 
Several of the recent storms listed above broke records. The December 2022 blizzard set snowfall records in 
the Buffalo area, for example, while Tropical Storm Lee caused record flooding in the Binghamton area and 
Superstorm Sandy caused unprecedented coastal flooding and destruction in New York City and on Long 
Island.53–55 Sandy’s storm surge traveled up the Hudson River all the way to Troy.53 Moreover, 5 of the top 10 
largest snowstorms in New York City (as measured in Central Park) have occurred since 2010.4 Specific 
examples like these are not proof alone that severe storms have become substantially more frequent or more 
intense on the whole in New York State. However, the observed increases in air temperature (section 3.1), 
ocean temperature (section 6.1), and Great Lakes water temperature (section 7.1) over the past century are 
indicative of conditions that favor the formation of stronger storms. Increased storm activity in general would 
be consistent with the observed increase in heavy precipitation events in New York (section 4.3). The North 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
33 
Atlantic basin overall has experienced an increase in the aggregate intensity of tropical cyclones since the mid-
1990s, but trends in frequency and longer-term trends in intensity are harder to discern.56,57  
Coastal storms are also becoming more destructive as a result of sea level rise. As average sea level rises 
steadily at all of New York’s measurement locations (section 6.2), it creates a higher base elevation onto which 
storm surge is added. A 2021 study attributed about $8.1 billion of Superstorm Sandy’s economic damages 
(13% of total damages) to the sea level rise associated with climate change.58 
5.1.2 Projections of Future Change 
Projected changes in the frequency and severity of storms in New York State depend on the type of storm. 
Some types and aspects of severe storms can be projected with reasonable certainty, while other types and 
aspects remain uncertain.59,60 Highlights from the literature include:  
 Heavy rain and snowstorms: As described in section 4.3, the projections developed for this 
assessment show with high confidence that precipitation in New York will increasingly fall in more 
intense events as the climate warms. 
 Tropical cyclones: Historical trends and climate model projections generally support the idea that 
tropical cyclone hazards—specifically winds and coastal and inland flooding—will increase over New York 
State over the course of the 21st century.4 However, there are many dimensions to the study of tropical 
cyclones, and some are understood with more certainty than others. The scientific literature suggests 
that the total number of tropical cyclones on average worldwide could stay the same or perhaps 
decrease slightly,61,62 but that the storms that do form will be stronger, with more intense wind and 
rain.63 The literature reports increasing confidence that intense tropical cyclones of category 3 and 
higher will become more frequent in the North Atlantic, and very high confidence that average rates of 
precipitation associated with tropical cyclones will increase.64 Other studies have examined potential 
changes in storm tracks, with implications for how many storms make landfall in New York. Some 
historical data and projections show maximum hurricane intensity shifting northward, which might be 
assumed to increase the chances of a strong hurricane reaching the state in the future.61 However, a 
2023 study projected that the number of hurricanes making landfall along the northeastern U.S. coast 
(including New York) is likely to decrease over the remainder of this century, while the southeastern 
Atlantic coast and the Gulf coast will experience an increase.65 That study examined the SSP5-8.5 very 
high emissions scenario using eight CMIP6 GCMs along with hurricane and stationary wave models, and 
it attributed the projected shifts in landfall primarily to changes in large-scale wind patterns known as 
steering flow.65 One 2022 study looked at forward velocity—how quickly storms move along their 
paths—and projected an increase in the likelihood of storms approaching New York from the east at 
slower speeds.63 Slower movement along the storm track could exacerbate damage, as seen during 
Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which brought record-breaking rainfall and flooding as it lingered over the 
Houston, Texas area for several days.  
 Extratropical cyclones: Future changes in extratropical storms are difficult to project. Several studies 
have projected a decrease in the total number of extratropical cyclones over North America and the 
Western Atlantic, but there is a possibility of an increase in storm intensity and precipitation on the East 
Coast.66 Moreover, projections from 10 CMIP5 models suggest that East Coast extratropical cyclones 
could become more intense and 5% to 25% wetter on the whole in the future.66 Whether winter 
nor’easters produce rain or snow will depend on air temperature, so more could be expected to deliver 
rain.4 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
34 
 Thunderstorms and lightning: Severe convective storms (i.e., thunderstorms) are generally 
expected to occur more frequently because of an overall increase in atmospheric conditions that 
promote the development of such storms.67–69 This projection is for the contiguous United States as a 
whole, but one 2007 study examined specific cities and projected that New York City will experience 
more than twice as many days favorable to thunderstorm formation in 2072–2099 compared with 
1962–1989.67 This 2007 study used the A2 emissions scenario, which comes from an older set of 
scenarios and involves warming close to, but not quite as high as, the SSP5-8.5 very high emissions 
scenario.  
Some studies have projected that lightning strikes will increase as a function of global average 
temperature70,71 and that the frequency of lightning strikes will increase in certain areas of New York 
State during the 21st century.72 However, other research suggests the possibility of a decrease.73 Thus, 
future trends in lightning remain uncertain.  
 Ice storms: Evidence suggesting increased frequency or severity of ice storms is limited. One 2011 
study modeled the possible effects of climate change on the occurrence of severe freezing rain events 
in eastern Canada and found a high degree of variation.74 They projected increases in ice storm 
occurrences in some regions during some seasons, and decreases in others.74 For portions of southern 
Ontario closest to New York, the total number of freezing rain events during winter could increase by 
35% to 80% by the period 2081–2100.74  
Projections of other types and aspects of severe storm events, including tornadoes, hail, and derechos, are not 
readily available.4 
5.2 Drought 
The USGCRP’s glossary defines drought as “An exceptional period of water shortage for existing ecosystems 
and the human population (due to low rainfall, high temperature and/or wind).”75 However, a more nuanced 
view recognizes a hierarchy of different types of drought, with “meteorological drought” describing a 
precipitation deficit (essentially the general definition given above), “agricultural drought” describing a soil 
moisture deficit, and “hydrological drought” describing a deficit in runoff.76 Drought can be measured over 
timescales ranging from weeks to years, and characterized using a variety of methods that range from simple 
precipitation-based indices to more sophisticated indices that incorporate variables such as relative humidity, 
potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and streamflow. These indices typically define drought in relation 
to a particular location’s “normal” or long-term average conditions. This means that even a relatively water-
rich area such as New York can experience periods classified as drought. 
New York State has not experienced drought impacts with the intensity and duration that often dominate 
headlines in other parts of the country, such as California and the Southwest. Nonetheless, the state has 
experienced—and will continue to experience—periods of drought.  
5.2.1 Historical Observations 
New York has fluctuated between periods of relative wetness and drought throughout the historical record. 
Figure 2-18 shows this pattern using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The PDSI has been used 
widely for many years in part because it is relatively simple to compute from available precipitation and 
temperature data. Other drought indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized 
Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) show a similar long-term pattern.77,78

Figure 2-18. Monthly drought conditions in New York State according to the Palmer Drought Severity Index, 1895–2022. 
Positive values represent wetter-than-average conditions, while negative values represent drier-than-average conditions. 
A value between -2 and -3 indicates moderate drought, -3 to -4 is severe drought, and -4 or below indicates extreme 
drought. The black line shows the ordinary least-squares linear trend (+0.013 PDSI units per year), which is significant to 
a 99% confidence level (p < 0.001). Data from NOAA (2023);14 index explanation from EPA (2021).79 
Linear regression (ordinary least-squares) of the NOAA data14 shown in Figure 2-18 shows a modest, 
statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in wetness at a rate of +0.013 PDSI units per year from 1895 to 
2022. An EPA analysis of trends in five-year SPEI values from 1900 to 2020 also found statistically significant 
increases in wetness across all parts of New York except for Long Island, which had no significant change.79  
Within the observed record, one particular multiyear drought in the 1960s stands out for its intensity and 
duration. This dry period is identified as the “drought of record” in many locations in New York State. 
Supplemental data from tree ring observations in very old trees suggests that the 1960s drought is 
representative of the most severe droughts in at least the last 500 years, if not longer.80,81 Since the 1960s 
drought, a wetter period has ensued, sometimes referred to as an epic pluvial, with increasing trends in 
precipitation and minimum streamflow.81–84 However, shorter periods of drought have continued to occur, 
including recent summer droughts that have had a particular impact on New York’s agriculture sector.37 
5.2.2 Projections of Future Change 
New projections of future drought were not developed as part of this assessment. However, the latest 
projections of temperature and precipitation at monthly to annual timescales shed some light on potential 
future changes in meteorological and agricultural drought conditions.  
Projected changes depend on timescale. The projected increases in total annual precipitation in New York 
(section 4.1) suggest that the risk of extended, multiyear droughts will not increase.4 However, shorter-
term seasonal droughts lasting from weeks to months could increase for a few reasons: 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
36 
 Changes in the distribution of precipitation toward larger events, as described in section 4.3, could imply 
longer dry spells between large events. A tendency of the jet stream toward stronger or more 
prolonged ridges of high pressure—with their associated high temperatures, sunny skies, and lack of 
rainfall—would increase the risk of rapid-onset “flash droughts.” 
 Higher temperatures in the warmer months could increase potential evapotranspiration and outweigh 
the influence of additional precipitation.85 Furthermore, as described in section 4.2, climate models 
disagree on whether precipitation will increase or decrease in summer and fall.  
 Reduced snow cover (section 4.4) and earlier spring snowmelt could increase drought risk in the 
summer as soils dry out earlier.4,86 
The possibility of increased summer droughts described here is consistent with the results of earlier analyses, 
including Zhao et al.87 and the 2014 ClimAID projections,88 showing that late-summer, short-term droughts will 
likely become more frequent in New York. 
5.3 Wildfire 
Wildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires that burn vegetation. While wildfires do not typically occur in New 
York State at the scale seen in other parts of the United States, the state does experience fires every year. 
These fires burn hundreds to thousands of acres per year of New York’s forests, marshlands, and other 
ecosystem types. Wildfires can directly harm people and structures, and they also produce particulate air 
pollution that can pose a hazard to human health.89  
5.3.1 Historical Observations 
From 1919 to 2018, New York experienced an average of 912 wildfires and 13,164 acres burned per year 
(Figure 2-19). Both the number and extent of fires have declined over this 100-year period. This period has 
actually seen an increase in “fire weather” conditions (high temperature, low humidity, high wind) across most 
of the state,90 consistent with the observed warm-season temperature increases described in section 3.2. Fire 
prevention and suppression activities have also increased; examples include bans on brush burning, changes 
in forest management practices, tighter regulations on logging and railroads after a series of large fires in the 
Adirondacks in the early 1900s, and enhanced networks (e.g., fire towers in the Adirondacks that were staffed 
for many years) to detect and respond to forest fires.91–93 
The New York State Department of Environmental Protection reports that nearly all (95%) of wildfires in New 
York from 1993 to 2017 were started by humans, with debris burning as the most common cause.93 Nearly 
50% of the state’s wildfires occur from March 15 to May 15.93 
New York State can also be affected by wildfires that occur in other states and Canada. For example, during 
June 2023, smoke from large wildfires in Canada blanketed New York, causing unhealthy air quality in much of 
the state.94,95 New York City reported the worst air quality of any city worldwide on June 7, far surpassing the 
city’s previous record-high concentration of fine particulate matter.96,97 A preliminary study suggests that 
climate change more than doubled the likelihood of the extremely warm, dry, and windy conditions that fueled 
these record-setting fires.98 This finding is consistent with widespread agreement in the literature that 
observed climate change has extended the fire season and increased the risk of wildfires in North 
America.99,100

Environmental Conservation (2023).101  
5.3.2 Projections of Future Change 
Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires in many states but is not likely 
to greatly expand the risk of wildfires in most of New York. Even though studies have projected percentage-
wise increases in annual fire probability for the state, the baseline fire probability is so low that the absolute 
projected change in fire occurrence is small, even under the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario.102 
One projection found that even under the highest emissions scenario, end-of-century fire probability in most of 
New York remained in the lowest category, with an annual probability of occurrence less than 0.1%.103 These 
projections largely agree with a 2022 study104 whose baseline (1984–2018) fire probability was modeled at 0% 
and whose fire probability for 2080–2099 under the intermediate, high, and very high emissions scenarios 
remained at 0%.  
However, additional studies project that the fire season in the Northeast will begin earlier in the year, peak 
earlier, and last longer.105 These changes are associated with a projected increase in weather conditions 
conducive to wildfire ignition and spread—a combination of temperature, moisture, and wind known as “fire 
weather.”105 Studies also project that the risk of widespread air quality impacts will increase in future decades 
as a result of the increased risk of large fires elsewhere in North America.106

Ocean Conditions 
6.1 Sea Surface Temperature 
Sea surface temperature, the temperature of the water at the ocean surface, is a key indicator of climate 
change. Because the ocean surface absorbs heat from the atmosphere, sea surface temperature is usually the 
warmest near the equator and coldest in the Arctic and Antarctic. Changes in sea surface temperature affect 
ocean circulation patterns, further influencing global climate through the transfer of heat back into the 
atmosphere.107 Sea surface temperature also affects storm formation, other aspects of weather, and marine 
life. 
6.1.1 Historical Observations 
Global average sea surface temperature increased from 1901 to 2020 at an average rate of 0.14°F per decade, 
with the largest increases starting around 1970.107 Nearly all locations within the world’s oceans have 
experienced statistically significant surface warming, including the entire northeastern U.S. coast.107  
Observed changes vary regionally. Along New York’s coast, water temperatures are influenced by the speed 
and locations of Atlantic circulation patterns, including a weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, 
poleward movement of the Gulf Stream, and retreat of cold Labrador waters such that a higher proportion of 
warm water is reaching the New York coast.108–110 Observed sea surface temperature trends in the region have 
included: 
 Warming of the northwest Atlantic overall by 0.67°F (0.37°C) per decade from 1982 to 2018.111 This 
rate is three times faster than the global average rate of 0.18°F per decade during a similar time 
frame.16 The rate of warming has accelerated in recent years; warming within the northeastern U.S. 
continental shelf region quadrupled during the period 2007–2016 compared with long-term trends.16,50  
 Warming of about 0.54°F (0.3°C) per decade for waters relatively close to New York—the inner portion 
of the Mid-Atlantic Bight—from 1982 to 2014.112  
 Warming of about 0.54°F (0.3°C) per decade for the Central Basin of Long Island Sound from 1948 to 
2012, based on monthly temperature data provided by NOAA’s Milford Laboratory in Connecticut.113  
 Increases in all four seasons within the New York Bight since the 1980s, with the greatest warming in 
summer and fall.114 
Marine heat waves (multiday periods with unusually warm surface water temperatures) occurred much more 
frequently in the New York Bight from 2010 to 2020 than in the preceding three decades (Figure 2-20). In 
2011 and 2015, more than half the days of the year had water temperatures higher than the historical 
threshold for defining a marine heat wave.114

ordinary least-squares linear trend (+3.4 days per year), which is significant to a 99% confidence level (p < 0.001). 
Figure from Gruenberg et al. (2021).114 
6.1.2 Projections of Future Change 
As global and regional air temperatures continue to increase, and as the oceans ultimately absorb much of the 
extra heat trapped by greenhouse gases, global and regional sea surface temperatures are also expected to 
continue rising. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (a driver of major ocean currents) is projected 
to continue to weaken, corresponding with expected warming in the Northwest Atlantic,109 although scientists 
continue to debate some of the uncertainties in ocean circulation projections. Climate projections indicate that 
this part of the ocean will continue to experience more warming than many other parts of the world.108 
Northeastern U.S. coastal waters have been projected to warm at a rate of up to 0.76°F (0.42°C) per decade 
through the period 2070–2099 under the SSP5-8.5 very high emissions scenario.115  
6.2 Sea Level and Coastal Flooding 
Global warming also raises global sea level. Two main factors drive this change: (1) water expands as it 
warms, and (2) a net loss of ice from ice sheets and glaciers adds to the volume of water contained in the 
ocean. Other contributing factors include ocean currents, circulation patterns, and gravitational effects of ice 
sheet loss that modify sea level regionally. Additionally, vertical land movement influences the way changing 
global sea level is perceived relative to the shoreline. Much of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast is at particular risk 
because of negative vertical land movement (i.e., the land is sinking at the same time global sea level is 
rising). This land subsidence is due to a combination of sediment compaction, groundwater extraction, and 
glacial isostatic adjustment, which is the slow process in which the Earth’s crust adjusts to the long-ago loss of 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
40 
Ice Age ice sheets.116 New York State’s coastal areas are generally subsiding at a rate of 1–2 millimeters per 
year.116 
Sea level rise adds substantial vulnerability to densely populated and ecologically rich coastal zones.117 Coastal 
areas such as Long Island, New York City, southern Westchester County, and the southern Hudson River 
Valley are at risk of rising sea levels and enhanced coastal flooding. Water levels in the Hudson are influenced 
by the tides—and therefore, by sea level—all the way up to the Federal Dam at Troy. 
6.2.1 Historical Observations 
Tide gauges operated by NOAA’s National Ocean Service have measured water levels along U.S. coastlines 
continuously for more than a century. New York has three gauges with long-term records: one at the eastern 
tip of Long Island (Montauk) and two in or adjacent to New York City (The Battery at the southern tip of 
Manhattan and Kings Point on Long Island Sound in Nassau County).  
The rate of local or relative sea level rise in New York City averaged 0.11 inches (2.90 millimeters) per year 
from 1856 to 2022 as measured by The Battery’s tide gauge, amounting to almost a foot of sea level rise in 
the last 100 years (Figure 2-21). The rate has accelerated to approximately 0.16 inches per year over the past 
40 years. At Montauk, sea level has risen relative to the shore at a rate of 0.14 inches (3.43 millimeters) per 
year from the start of measurement (1947) to 2022. Both sites’ long-term rates are double the 1920–2022 
global average rate, due largely to the regional subsidence caused by glacial isostatic adjustment as described 
above.4 
Although storm surges have historically caused more damage, high tide flooding (often referred to as 
“nuisance” or “sunny day” flooding) is also becoming increasingly common along New York State’s tidally 
influenced coastline. As sea level has risen in New York, so has the number of coastal flood days (Table 2-4). 
For example, Table 2-4 shows that floods that happened an average of twice a year at Kings Point in the 
1950s and 1960s now occur an average of 10 times a year. Studies have shown that the observed increase in 
high tide flooding can be attributed to sea level rise: of 279 flood days recorded at Kings Point and 63 at The 
Battery from 1985 to 2014, 111 days at Kings Point 34 at The Battery would likely not have happened without 
sea level rise.118 Dredging and filling of wetlands has also increased flood risk in urbanized areas of New York. 
For example, modeling shows that most of the 15 minor flood events observed in Jamaica Bay in 2020 would 
not have happened without sea level rise and landscape changes since the 1870s: only one would have 
occurred without sea level rise, and only two would have occurred without landscape changes.119 In some low-
lying coastal neighborhoods such as Howard Beach in Queens, New York City, high tide floods submerge 
streets even before reaching the established flood threshold.119

as local vertical land motion. Each graph shows monthly averages, adjusted to exclude regular seasonal fluctuations from 
coastal ocean temperatures, salinity, wind, atmospheric pressure, and ocean current. “Zero” inches represents the most 
recent tidal datum (official reference elevation) established for each site, so data are plotted relative to this standard 
height. Ordinary least-squares linear trends are shown for reference; changes at both The Battery (+0.11 inches per year 
over the full period shown, p < 0.001) and Montauk (+0.14 inches per year, p < 0.001) are statistically significant to a 
99% confidence level. Data from NOAA (2023).9  
Box 3  Community science to document changing water levels 
The MyCoast New York portal enables New Yorkers to submit and analyze photos of changing water levels, 
shorelines, and hazardous weather impacts across the state’s varied coasts and water bodies. Photos are 
linked to real-time environmental conditions to create reports that help stakeholders such as government 
agencies, business owners, and residents understand the changing environment and make informed 
decisions. Volunteers have submitted hundreds of reports of both inland and coastal flooding across New 
York State.120 
6.2.2 Projections of Future Change 
Sea level is projected to rise along the New York State coastline and in the tidal Hudson throughout the 21st 
century and beyond. Table 2-3 presents projections from this assessment, all computed relative to a 1995–
2014 baseline. These projections show sea level rising by up to 1 foot by the 2030s, about 2–3 feet by the 
2080s, and more than 4 feet by the year 2150. Under certain scenarios with a high rate of ice loss from 
Greenland, Antarctica, and glaciers—such as a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet—New York could 
plausibly experience sea level rise much higher than 4 feet by 2150. The ranges shown in Table 2-3 reflect a 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
42 
combination of three possible scenarios, including a rapid ice melt scenario at the upper end. Looking at a 
rapid ice melt scenario alone (not blended with other scenarios) would lead to higher estimates. For example, 
the 2019 New York City Panel on Climate Change report examined an Antarctic rapid ice melt (ARIM) scenario 
and projected that it would lead to sea level rise of 81 inches by the 2080s and 114 inches by the year 2100 in 
New York City.4 Local and regional factors are likely to continue to cause New York’s sea level to rise more 
than the global average, based on projections through 2150 for the northeastern U.S. coast (Maine to 
Virginia).121

Note: Sea level rise in inches relative to a 1995–2014 baseline. Ranges given represent the 25th to 75th percentiles of a 
blended set of three scenarios used by the IPCC: SSP2-4.5 with medium confidence, SSP5-8.5 with medium confidence, 
and SSP5-8.5 with low confidence. The latter scenario reflects the plausibility of higher-end sea level rise associated with 
accelerated loss of land-based ice. Data from projections developed for this assessment.3 
Sea level rise is expected to continue to increase the height and frequency of the state’s coastal floods in 
future decades. While New York City currently experiences approximately 10 high tide floods per year as 
measured at The Battery, that number could rise to 60–85 days by the 2040s (Table 2-4). This projection 
means chronic flooding could affect low-lying coastal neighborhoods once a week or more. Regular tidal flood 
events will progressively affect additional low-lying coastal areas, such as the Rockaways and other 
neighborhoods near Jamaica Bay (Figure 2-22). Furthermore, the combination of sea level rise and storm 
surge will increase the frequency, extent, and severity of coastal flooding even if storm patterns remain the 
same122—and, as section 5.1 explains, coastal storms are also projected to become more intense over time.

regarding the interpretation and use of this map. 
6.3 Acidification 
Over the past 250 years, the world’s oceans have absorbed about 28% of the carbon dioxide produced by 
human activities.125 Carbon dioxide reacts with sea water to produce carbonic acid, so an increase in dissolved 
carbon dioxide leads to an increase in acidity (lower pH values).126 This in turn changes the balance of 
minerals in the water and makes it more difficult for shellfish and other organisms to produce calcium 
carbonate, the main ingredient in their hard skeletons or shells. Thus, declining pH can make it more difficult 
for these animals to thrive. Such changes can affect ecosystems and the people who depend on them.102,127 
Local processes that affect acidity in New York’s coastal waters also include ocean circulation patterns, natural 
seasonal variability, upwelling, eutrophication, and stormwater runoff from densely populated coastal urban 
areas.128–130 Acidification also occurs in freshwater systems such as the Great Lakes.131 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
44 
6.3.1 Historical Observations 
It is virtually certain that the ocean’s surface globally has undergone increasing acidification by absorbing 
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.132 Within the state’s coastal waters, there is evidence of increased 
acidification as shown by measures of surface water dissolved carbon dioxide.133 Surveys of surface carbonate 
chemistry conducted by NOAA and others show large natural seasonal and spatial variability and possible 
decadal changes.128,130 To date, however, trends in acidification within northeastern U.S. coastal waters have 
related more to regional warming and large-scale ocean circulation than to changes in atmospheric carbon 
dioxide.134,135 Stormwater runoff is also considered to be a more immediate driver of acidification. Long Island 
Sound experiences daily and seasonal fluctuations in pH corresponding with low dissolved oxygen and high 
chlorophyll. The greatest fluctuations occur in the bottom waters of the western Sound. Acidification is also 
observed in Hempstead Bay and Jamaica Bay, where coastal acidity has reduced growth and survival of fish 
and shellfish.136 
 
In the Great Lakes, local primary productivity and historical impacts from acid deposition influence seasonal 
and spatial variability in pH.137 Streams and rivers in the eastern United States show increasing trends in 
alkalinity,138 and studies elsewhere support the intuitive conclusion that this trend could work to counteract 
acidification in coastal waters, at least near the mouths of large rivers.139 
6.3.2 Projections of Future Change 
Assessments agree that the global ocean will further acidify over the 21st century, exacerbated by continued 
carbon uptake. Continued acidification over the coming century is projected to result in a further decline of up 
to 0.3 pH units in the global surface ocean by 2081–2100, relative to 2006–2015, under the very high 
emissions (SSP5-8.5) scenario.132 The northeastern United States faces elevated risk due to weak buffering 
capacity, extreme precipitation events, and increased overall precipitation that will add more runoff to coastal 
waters. As a result, the northeastern U.S. coast is expected to experience some of the earliest impacts from 
ocean acidification.129 
The Great Lakes are projected to continue to acidify at a similar rate and magnitude as the ocean as a result 
of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.131,140 
There are still sizable knowledge gaps related to the drivers of large-scale variability of regional ocean 
acidification. These gaps are being addressed by the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Acidification Network141 and the 
newly created New York Ocean Acidification Task Force initiated by the New York State Department of 
Environmental Conservation.130,136 New studies are underway, including one examining the relationship 
between acidification and harmful algal blooms.142

Lakes and Rivers 
7.1 Lake and Stream Water Temperature  
Climate change—particularly rising temperature and increasing precipitation—affects the thermal and 
hydrologic dynamics of lakes, rivers, and streams, which in turn affects their biogeochemistry, biodiversity, and 
ecological processes. Overall, warmer air temperatures increase the temperature of freshwater systems, with 
variations depending on depth and other characteristics of lakes. Warming also influences thermal stratification 
(the separation of water masses by temperature), a key physical attribute of lakes that regulates numerous 
chemical and biological characteristics. Increased temperature leads to earlier snowmelt, which affects lake 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
45 
and stream water levels along with increased precipitation. New York State has a high density of lakes and 
streams compared with other parts of the country. Because of the diversity of geographic characteristics 
across the state, the impacts to freshwater systems will not be uniform statewide.  
7.1.1 Historical Observations 
Evidence indicates that fresh water bodies in New York have warmed over recent decades: 
 Surface waters in Lakes Erie and Ontario warmed from 1995 to 2022; both lakes’ changes are 
significant to a 95% confidence level (Figure 2-23). The observed warming has been most notable 
during the spring and summer months.143 Additional studies have noted that the northern and 
easternmost portions of each Great Lake, especially in near-shore areas, have experienced the highest 
rates of warming.144 Warming surface temperature in the Great Lakes increases rates of evaporation 
and increases the length of the season for evaporation by delaying lake ice formation, which can 
contribute to lower water levels (although additional precipitation with climate change can offset this 
effect).145 See section 7.3 for more discussion on ice cover and section 7.4 for water levels.  
 One study of 231 lakes across northeastern North America, including 15 in New York State, found that 
overall the lakes had increasing near-surface temperature and thermal stratification strength from 1975 
to 2014.146 
 Warming surface waters and stable deep-water temperatures have led to increases in the temperature 
difference through the water column of many lakes in New York State and throughout the temperate 
zone worldwide.147 These increases in the temperature difference increase the density difference 
between water column layers and hence increase the strength of stratification. Additionally, the 
seasonal duration of stratification is increasing by 3.7 days per decade, as lakes worldwide are 
stratifying earlier than in past decades and seasonal summer stratification is lasting longer into the 
fall.148  
 Stream water temperature shows warming trends in the Mid-Atlantic region, including statistically 
significant warming from 1960 to 2010 at several stream gauging sites in Pennsylvania, near the New 
York border.149 Many gauging sites within New York also have several decades of temperature 
measurements available from the U.S. Geological Survey. However, a detailed analysis of warming 
trends would need to ensure methodological comparability over time and presumably avoid waterways 
where water temperature is influenced substantially by hydromodifications or industrial thermal 
discharges. In New York State, elevation, riparian forest cover, landscape slope, and growing degree 
days have been found to be the strongest predictors of water temperature in streams.150 The statistical 
association with growing degree days—a measured based on air temperature—supports the assertion 
that warmer air drives warming in streams.  
Lakes in the northeastern United States could be changing faster than those in other mid-latitude regions of 
the world due to regionally warmer and wetter conditions, but local characteristics contribute to variability in 
thermal trends.146 Nonetheless, the patterns observed in New York are consistent with global trends. In a 
worldwide study of lakes, surface water temperatures increased at a median rate of 0.61°F (0.34°C) per 
decade over the period 1985–2009.151 Other more recent assessments provide similar trend estimates.147,152 
Recent global investigations have highlighted an increase in the intensity and duration of aquatic heat waves, 
which are periods with much greater than normal water temperatures, in some lakes.153 However, global 
evidence indicates that deep-water temperatures have not consistently warmed, and in some cases have even 
cooled.147,152

46 
Some uncertainties remain. While individual lake temperatures across the state are regularly monitored by 
government agencies, academic organizations, and individuals via programs such as the Citizens Statewide 
Lake Assessment Program and the Adirondacks Lakes Survey, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of 
these data. As noted above, time-series analysis of temperature data for streams is also limited.

graphs on the left show the average annual surface temperature from 1995 to 2022. Ordinary least-squares linear trends 
are shown for reference as black lines; Lake Erie (+0.68°F per decade, p = 0.012) and Lake Ontario (+0.91°F per

average temperatures from 1995 to 2004 with daily average temperatures from 2013 to 2022. Data from NOAA Great 
Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (2023),154 expanding on previous analysis by EPA (2021).143 
7.1.2 Projections of Future Change 
Lake warming trends are expected to continue worldwide through the 21st century. Additionally, lakes are 
projected to experience increasingly severe heat waves in future decades.153 For example, under the very high 
emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), lake heat waves are projected to increase in duration worldwide from an 
average of 8 days per year (over the period 1970–1999) to about 96 days by the end of the 21st century.153 
Under the same scenario, the annual duration of stratification in Northern Hemisphere lakes is projected to 
increase by 33 days by 2099.155 Within New York, one study of a large, relatively shallow lake (Oneida Lake—
the largest lake entirely within New York) projected that by 2100 under a relatively high emissions scenario, 
water temperatures could increase by 6.7°F (3.70°C) at 2 meters depth and 6.1°F (3.37°C) at 10 meters 
depth, and the number of consecutive days of stratification could increase by 61 days.156 
Surface temperatures are projected to increase across all five Great Lakes, but with strong seasonal and 
spatial variability. The largest increases are projected for Lakes Superior and Ontario.157 The strongest 
warming is projected in spring and extends into summer, due to earlier and more intense stratification.157 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2

47 
For rivers and streams, modeling studies show that air temperature strongly predicts water temperature, 
which is consistent with observed relationships.149,150 This finding would suggest continued warming of New 
York’s rivers and streams as air temperatures rise in the decades ahead. Increased streamflow associated with 
increased precipitation could offset some of this warming effect, however.149  
7.2 Inland Flooding 
Inland flooding occurs in two forms: 
 Fluvial: Flooding due to a river, stream, or lake overflowing its banks onto adjacent land. Sustained 
heavy precipitation and rapid snowmelt are among the conditions that can lead to fluvial flooding. 
 Pluvial: Flooding as a direct result of intense rainfall that floods an area more quickly than the water 
can be absorbed or conveyed away by the landscape or by built infrastructure. This category can 
include flash floods, cases where heavy rain overwhelms an urban stormwater system, and cases where 
rain falls on a landscape where the ground is already saturated. 
Both types of inland flooding are caused by heavy precipitation, so an increase in heavy storms in a changing 
climate (section 4.3) will raise the risk of floods. 
7.2.1 Historical Observations 
The U.S. Geological Survey maintains thousands of stream gauges that measure stream water level and 
discharge across the United States, including many in New York State. From 1965 to 2015, floods measured at 
stream gauges generally became larger and more frequent in rivers and streams across large parts of the 
Northeast, including at all 10 stream gauges with adequate long-term data in New York.158 However, only one 
of the New York sites had a statistically significant increase (Poisson regression with Mann-Kendall test, 
significant to a 95% confidence level), and it was only for flood magnitude, not frequency.158 
Recent flood events have severely affected the state, including a 2003 flood in Binghamton,159 Hurricane Irene 
and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, a storm in August 2014 that broke precipitation records on Long Island,39 the 
remnants of Hurricane Ida in the New York City area in September 2021, and July 2023 flash flooding in the 
Hudson Valley and the Finger Lakes region.160 These events were associated with extreme rates of 
precipitation.  
Floods can be difficult to quantify and track thoroughly over time, as many flood events are not recorded—
especially rapidly occurring pluvial floods, which are not measured by stream gauges on rivers. In the absence 
of systematic data collection on floods themselves, comprehensive data on the monetary damages caused by 
floods can offer a useful proxy for tracking. Financial damages data show that flooding occurs in every county 
in New York State, but the risk varies widely, with the largest historical damages occurring in the Susquehanna 
and Delaware watersheds (Figure 2-24).

Figure 2-24. Financial damages from flooding in New York State per capita by county, 1996–2017. This data set does 
not include damages associated with hurricanes or coastal flooding, nor does it capture inland flooding events since 2017, 
some of which have been notable. Flood damages from the New York State Division of Homeland Security and 
Emergency Services (2019),161 normalized using population estimates from the New York State Department of Labor 
(2023)162 that have been averaged from 1996 to 2017 by county.  
7.2.2 Projections of Future Change 
This assessment did not attempt to quantify future flood risks for specific water bodies in New York, but other 
studies have reached conclusions relevant to the state: 
 Across most regions of the United States, including the Northeast, projected damages from river 
flooding could more than double with warming around 5.4°F (3°C), which is expected to be reached 
around the 2050s (section 3.1).163  
 EPA’s Climate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis program used the First Street Foundation’s widely cited 
flooding risk data and model to generate projections of inland flood risk and damages by census block 
group and tract across the contiguous 48 states.164 This analysis projected that warming of 3.6°F 
(2.0°C) above the 2001–2020 average will be associated with increased inland flood damages in much 
of Eastern New York but decreased damages in much of the western part of the state. With 7.2°F 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
49 
(4.0°C) warming, most (though not all) of the state is projected to experience increased inland flood 
damages. 
 Extreme river flows are projected to continue increasing in the northeastern United States in the winter 
months, associated with wetter weather in the winter. Extreme inland flooding is projected to increase 
in intensity and extent.165  
 In the Great Lakes, compound impacts on water level caused by lake seiche (section 7.5) and high river 
flow could result in a higher probability of flooding along the shore.166 
The forthcoming Water Resources chapter provides more detail on projections of streamflow in general, noting 
a likely increase in annual discharge along with a shift toward earlier winter/spring peak flows.  
7.3 Lake Ice Cover 
Ice cover records represent some of the longest-running observations of the effects of climate change in New 
York. Climate influences the timing and extent of ice cover on lakes through air temperature, cloud cover, 
wind, and other conditions within the watershed such as rain and snowmelt. Shorter periods of ice cover on 
lakes are a sign that the climate is warming. Ice cover duration and extent can affect recreational activities, 
commercial shipping, and the rate of evaporation—which in turn feeds lake-effect precipitation downwind of 
large lakes such as Erie and Ontario. 
7.3.1 Historical Observations 
Many lakes with long-term records have displayed a clear and substantial decline in ice cover.167–169 In New 
York, several lakes have ice cover records documenting the onset, duration, and breakup of winter ice cover 
for more than a century. The following trends are all significant to a 95% confidence level:  
 Mirror Lake (Lake Placid): Ice-on (freeze) date has shifted later by 11 days since 1903; thaw date has 
shifted 6 days earlier since 1905.170 
 Lower Saint Regis Lake (Adirondacks): Thaw date has shifted earlier by 7 days since 1909.171 
 Otsego Lake (Cooperstown): Freeze date has shifted later by 11 days since 1849.170 
 Lake George: Thaw date has shifted earlier by 7 days since 1905.170 
 Lake Champlain has an ice cover record going back to the early 1800s and has exhibited an increase in 
the frequency of ice-free winters in recent decades.172 
Increases in winter temperature have also affected ice cover on the Great Lakes.39 The duration of ice cover 
on Lake Ontario has decreased at a rate of 0.87 days per year since the start of systematic measurement in 
1973 (linear regression, p = 0.005).173 Trends vary spatially, with the most significant decrease in duration of 
ice cover happening near the shoreline of each lake (Figure 2-25).173 Various studies have also reported 
decreases in maximum seasonal ice coverage in the Great Lakes since 1973,50,174 although a recent analysis of 
these data found that changes in maximum ice-covered area were not statistically significant to a 95% 
confidence level for Lake Erie and Lake Ontario from 1973 to 2020.173 Nonetheless, there is some evidence 
that seasons with lower-than-usual ice cover are becoming more common. For example, while Lake Erie has a 
history of freezing almost completely, there have been six years on record when Lake Erie was mostly ice-free, 
and all of those occurred since 1998.39

shows the average rate of change in ice cover duration from 1973 to 2019 for each grid cell where the ordinary least-
squares linear regression trend is significant to a 90% level. All other pixels are gray. A pixel is considered “ice covered” 
each day that it is at least 10% covered by ice. Data from NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, 
analyzed by EPA.173 
7.3.2 Projections of Future Change 
Ice losses are projected to continue in future decades as winters warm. By 2100, the Great Lakes are 
projected to have ice covering only 3% to 15% of the lake surface during the peak winter month under the 
very high emissions scenario, and 10% to 40% under the intermediate emissions scenario.157 Ice duration is 
projected to decrease by up to 60 days in waters near the shore of the Great Lakes.157 Among smaller lakes in 
New York, Lower Saint Regis Lake in the Adirondacks is expected to lose an additional 7–21 days of ice cover 
by 2100.171  
As noted in section 4.4, reduced ice cover on large lakes, especially the Great Lakes, is expected to contribute 
to more lake-effect precipitation over land. This is because ice cover greatly reduces heat flux over lakes, and 
it has also been shown to cause other changes, such as lower wind speeds, that reduce evaporation.175 
Removing the constraint of ice cover leads to more evaporation and subsequent precipitation. Studies indicate 
the possibility of increased lake-effect snowfall over the next several decades, but more rain instead of snow 
by later in the century as temperatures continue to rise.41,48,49  
7.4 Lake Levels 
New York has approximately 580 miles of continuous shoreline along Lake Erie, the Niagara River, Lake 
Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River. This shoreline supports four major ports that handle 1.1 million tons of 
inbound and outbound cargo and generate $78 million in business revenue annually.176 However, commerce 
facilitated by the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Seaway in New York is vulnerable to fluctuations in lake levels. For 
example, every inch of decrease in lake levels can reduce freighter cargo capacity by 100 tons or more.177 
Fluctuations in lake levels also can have substantial consequences for ecological health, recreation, tourism, 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
51 
and housing. For example, high lake levels can lead to erosion, flooding, and property damage, as other 
chapters of this assessment discuss in more detail. 
Several factors influence Great Lakes water levels on various timescales. Over hourly timescales, wind can 
cause surges that raise water levels on one side of the lake, followed by oscillations known as seiches (section 
7.5).178 Lake levels are also influenced by seasonal variation. Water levels tend to be higher in the spring and 
early summer due to snowmelt, rainstorms, and cooler water temperatures leading to less evaporation, 
whereas water levels tend to be lower in the fall and early winter.178 Fluctuations in lake levels over multiyear 
time scales are caused by a confluence of factors, including long-term patterns in air and water temperatures, 
precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and ice duration throughout the Great Lakes basin and beyond.179 
Water levels in the St. Lawrence River–Lake Ontario system are additionally influenced by the International 
Joint Commission’s regulation of Lake Ontario’s outflow at the Moses-Saunders Power Dam,180 although this 
influence is limited.178,179 
7.4.1 Historical Observations 
Water levels in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario have fluctuated since 1860, with 4 to 5 feet of difference between 
the lowest and highest recorded annual averages (Figure 2-26). Following highs recorded during the 1980s 
and into the 1990s, lake levels subsequently declined, with 1998–2013 characterized by below-average lake 
levels. From 2015 to 2020, the Great Lakes experienced some higher-than-average, sometimes record-
breaking lake levels attributed to above-average precipitation and high ice cover.181 For example, in 2017 and 
2019, Lake Ontario experienced record flooding, prompting New York’s governor to declare a state of 
emergency in counties along the lake in both instances.182–184 One survey found that this flooding resulted in 
an average loss of $95,000 per home among affected households.185

the range of monthly average water levels, and the line in the middle shows the annual average. The graph uses the 
1981–2010 average as a baseline for depicting change. Data from NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, 
analyzed by EPA.143 
7.4.2 Projections of Future Change 
Projections of future lake levels are limited due to the difficulty of simulating land–air–lake processes and the 
high spatial resolution needed to generate accurate estimates.179,181 However, there is general agreement 
across models that annual and multiyear variability in Great Lakes water levels will increase. Models suggest 
there will be “prolonged periods of both high and low levels,” meaning that wide shifts similar to those recently 
observed in Lake Ontario, from lower-than-average levels in 2012 to record highs in 2017, will become more 
common.181 Lake level variability will most likely be driven by periods of drought and extreme precipitation 
events.179 At a seasonal scale, high water levels from late winter through early summer could be enhanced due 
to anticipated increases in springtime precipitation and runoff, particularly for Lake Ontario.186 
Although models suggest an increase in variability, there is no scientific consensus as to whether lake levels 
will increase or decrease overall.181 Some older modeling studies predicted a net decline in Great Lakes water 
levels, while updated models have predicted levels to remain steady or to increase slightly.145,181,187 For 
example, in a 2005 study, all five Great Lakes were projected to experience a water level decrease on average 
by 2050, including declines of 32.7 inches (0.83 meters) in Lake Erie and 20.9 inches (0.53 meters) in Lake 
Ontario.188 In contrast, more recent projections published by the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and 
Assessments suggest that 2036–2065 average lake levels will be higher than the 1961–2000 average lake 
levels for Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.186,189 Another study in 2022 projected increased water levels, with Lake 
Erie increasing by about 11 inches (0.28 meters) by 2040–2049 relative to a 2010–2019 baseline.190 (This 
study and some others did not model Lake Ontario because of the different considerations required to account 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
53 
for that lake’s regulated outflows.) Using a different method, a 2022 study projected increases of 2.4–3.5 
inches (6–9 centimeters) in average Lake Erie water levels through 2050, along with increased month-to-
month variability and seasonal shifts.187 Due to model limitations and the nature of lake level variability, 
projected trends and extremes in lake levels should be interpreted with caution. 
7.5 Seiches 
Seiches are standing waves that form when strong winds or changes in atmospheric pressure push water 
toward one end of a body of water. Upon release, water rebounds and begins to oscillate, with oscillations 
typically having a period of three or more hours.191 Substantial seiches occur within the Great Lakes, although 
the magnitude and frequency of these events do not follow a repetitive, spatially uniform pattern like ocean 
tides. Seiches typically cause the largest water level increases in bays and at the ends of lakes. One recent 
modeling study quantified the potential contribution of seiches to erosion and flooding at the eastern end of 
Lake Erie.192 Still, the ecological role that seiches play within Great Lakes bays and wetlands remains relatively 
understudied.193 
7.5.1 Historical Observations 
Only limited historical data exist about seiches, as most records of seiches are biased toward extreme events 
and do not capture smaller, more common day-to-day water level fluctuations driven by seiches. One 2006 
study found that seiches cause daily water levels to fluctuate an average of approximately 1.6 inches on Lake 
Ontario and more than 7.9 inches on Lake Erie.193 Seiches tend to be more powerful in Lake Erie than in the 
other Great Lakes because of Lake Erie’s orientation, size, shallow depth, and shape. On Lake Erie in 
particular, extreme seiches can hinder commercial shipping, damage infrastructure, and result in temporary 
disruptions of drinking water supplies.194 For example, in 2008, strong winds caused waves as high as 12 to 16 
feet and led to flooding in some areas of Buffalo.191 
7.5.2  Projections of Future Change 
Seiches are difficult to predict.145 Because of their transient nature and the limited amount of historical data 
available, seiches are often not considered during discussions of climate change’s impact on Great Lakes water 
levels.195 Some researchers have suggested that increased storm frequency and length will produce more and 
stronger seiches on the Great Lakes,196 and others have noted that ice cover suppresses seiche motion, so 
reduced ice cover could lead to larger seiches and more associated damage during winter.192 There is an 
ongoing need to learn more about seiches and how they could change in a warmer future.197 
8 
Compound Events 
The extreme events and elevated risks described in sections 3–7 can become more severe and damaging 
when multiple stressors combine or co-occur. These combinations, referred to as compound events, have 
occurred historically in New York State. As many of the individual risks increase with climate change, it follows 
that the risk of increasingly severe combinations will also grow. 
Compound events fall into four main categories, all relevant to the state: 
 Preconditioned events occur when one or more hazards cause an impact, or lead to an amplified 
impact, only because of a pre-existing, climate-driven condition. Examples include heavy rainfall on top 
of snow and false spring (when cold conditions return after unseasonable warmth).37 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
54 
 Multivariable events refer to the co-occurrence of multiple climate hazards in the same geographic 
area. Examples include the combined effects of heat and humidity (see section 3.4 regarding the heat 
index), compound flooding events in coastal storms (e.g., heavy rain, strong winds, storm surge), and 
the vulnerability of communities along the tidal Hudson River to flooding from a combination of high 
streamflows and tidal flooding exacerbated by sea level rise.198 As an example of the combined effects 
of heat and humidity, a 2017 study found that under the very high emissions scenario, by about 2070, 
the northeastern United States could experience approximately 30 days per year where the heat and 
humidity combined are higher than the level that historically occurred only once per year (i.e., wet-bulb 
temperature relative to the 1985–2005 average annual maximum).199 
 Temporally compounding events refer to a succession of hazards that affect a given geographic 
area, creating or amplifying an impact when compared with a single hazard. Examples include a heat 
wave after a coastal storm has knocked out power,200 a cold snap after a destructive storm (as occurred 
with Superstorm Sandy in 2012), and back-to-back nor’easters associated with persistent troughs in the 
jet stream. It remains unclear whether events associated with a “stuck” jet stream are becoming more 
frequent and intense with climate change, given large natural variability and inconclusive results from 
modeling experiments. 
 Spatially compounding events occur when multiple connected locations are affected by the same or 
different hazards within a limited time window, causing an impact. For example, the entire Northeast 
could experience heavy precipitation over the same period, leading to large increases in riverine flood 
risk in New York State and beyond. More widespread heat waves associated with climate change could 
limit energy supplies for New York as neighboring states and provinces face their own high demand for 
cooling, as broader analyses have suggested.201 Other examples could include disrupted supply chains 
or simultaneous crop failures that affect food prices and food security.202 
Some authors have considered cases in which compounding goes beyond climate hazards to include other 
aspects of human and natural systems,203 such as the risk of power failures and poor air quality, both of which 
are correlated with extreme heat. Other chapters of this assessment explore these types of compounding 
impacts. 
Traceable Accounts 
Traceable accounts examine each key finding in depth. They provide citations that support each assertion and 
present the authors’ assessment of confidence in each finding. 
Key Finding 1 
Average and maximum temperatures have increased in New York State since the early 20th 
century and are projected to continue to rise throughout the 21st century. The state has warmed 
more rapidly than the national average, and winter is warming more rapidly than other seasons. Heat waves 
are expected to occur more often and become more intense, posing greater risks for human health, built 
infrastructure, ecosystems, and other sectors. New York City is projected to remain the warmest part of the 
state; northern regions will continue to be relatively cooler while still experiencing large increases in 
temperature and extreme heat.

55 
Description of Evidence Base  
Warming of the climate system is widely established as a fundamental component of climate change—a fact 
supported by a vast body of scientific literature and acknowledged with the highest possible confidence by the 
USGCRP and IPCC’s authoritative national and global assessments.1,2 Evidence of observed warming in New 
York State comes from long-term, quality-controlled weather stations that have been carefully screened and 
selected for use in climatology. Within this data set, stations analyzed for this assessment show warming from 
1901 to 2020 in every region of the state, and 24 out of 27 stations had a significant (p < 0.01) linear trend in 
annual mean temperature over this time period.4 When averaged statewide, mean temperature increased at a 
rate of 0.21°F per decade from 1901 to 2022—a trend that is highly significant (p < 0.001) and larger than the 
contiguous 48 states’ average rate of 0.17°F per decade.14 Analysis of seasonal temperature observations from 
the same long-term, quality-controlled data set shows highly significant warming for New York State on the 
whole in all four seasons over the period 1901–2022 (linear trends with p < 0.01 for spring and < 0.001 for 
the other three seasons).14 Among these highly significant trends, winter’s regression slope was about twice 
that of any other season.14  
The projections developed for this assessment show strong agreement that mean temperatures, extreme 
temperatures, high heat-index days (a combination of heat and humidity), and the frequency of multiday heat 
waves will increase in all regions of New York State during the 21st century. These projections use what are 
widely acknowledged to be the best climate models currently available (the CMIP6 suite), which reflect the 
state of the science in global climate modeling and have been used in the most recent IPCC global 
assessment1 and the Fifth National Climate Assessment.2 The direction of change is consistent across every 
available CMIP6 climate model under both emissions scenarios that bound the likely range used for this 
assessment (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5).  
The assertion that more extreme heat raises risks for human health, built infrastructure, ecosystems, and 
other sectors is backed up by empirical studies and modeled relationships presented throughout this 
assessment’s other forthcoming chapters.  
New York City’s projected 50th percentile annual mean temperature for the 2080s, 62.6°F, is higher than that 
of any other region in the state, and the lower end of New York City’s likely range for the 2080s (60.8°F) is 
equal to the upper bound of the next-warmest region’s likely range (South Hudson). These findings suggest a 
strong likelihood that New York City will remain the hottest part of the state. The projections show wide 
agreement that New York’s northernmost regions will remain the coolest on average, but all regions are 
projected to warm by a similar amount (5–11°F) from the 1981–2010 baseline to the 2080s. The projections 
cited here for New York State align with projections of increased mean and extreme temperatures reported in 
national and global assessments.1,2  
New Information and Remaining Uncertainties  
The width of the projected ranges for future mean temperatures given in section 3.1.2 results in part from the 
fundamental uncertainty about which greenhouse gas emissions trajectory the world will follow most closely. 
This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of future change with high precision, even for a 
variable as well studied and closely related to greenhouse gas concentrations as temperature. However, the 
overall direction of change in New York State (i.e., increasing mean and extreme temperatures) is projected to 
be the same regardless of where actual greenhouse gas emissions fall within the likely range. 
Although observed trends show greater warming in winter than in other seasons, there is too much 
uncertainty in the climate models to conclude that this trend will continue.  
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
56 
Some studies suggest that extremely high daily temperatures and multiday heat wave frequency, duration, 
and intensity have already increased in New York State. Multiple studies using data from long-term, quality-
controlled weather stations have found increases in extreme heat in New York State using a variety of 
definitions and thresholds (for example, heat waves using absolute versus local percentile-based thresholds, 
and based on either maximum or minimum daily temperatures).12,13,23 Using certain definitions, however, 
certain weather stations in New York State have not experienced statistically significant changes in these 
phenomena. Thus, this key finding does not claim an observed increase in extreme heat. Still, no stations 
experienced significant decreases in extreme heat in the studies analyzed for this assessment. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence  
There is very high confidence in all portions of this finding, given the preponderance of observed evidence 
from widespread long-term monitoring, agreement among all models and climate scenarios regarding the 
direction of future change in mean and extreme temperatures, and consistency with highly confident findings 
from authoritative national and global assessments. 
Key Finding 2 
New York State has experienced increases in total precipitation and heavy precipitation events, 
and these trends will continue through the end of this century. Heavy rainstorms that lead to flooding 
are projected to become more frequent across the state. Precipitation is expected to increase the most in 
winter. Lake-effect snowfall is projected to increase over the next few decades, but as temperatures continue 
to rise, more winter precipitation near the Great Lakes will fall as rain. Elsewhere in the state, snowfall and 
snowpack are likely to decrease with warmer winter temperatures. 
Description of Evidence Base  
Evidence of observed increases in total precipitation in New York State comes from long-term, quality-
controlled weather stations that have been carefully screened and selected for use in climatology. Within this 
data set, 19 of the 27 stations analyzed for this assessment had statistically significant increases in total 
annual precipitation from 1901 to 2020 (p < 0.05), and none of the others experienced a significant decrease.4 
The assessment team’s separate analysis of data aggregated statewide found a highly significant (p < 0.001) 
increase in annual total precipitation from 1901 to 2022, at an average long-term linear rate of 0.47 inches per 
decade.14 For comparison, the long-term statewide average over this time frame was 41.1 inches per year.14 
Along the linear line of best fit, calculations show an estimated change from 1901 to 2022 that equates to a 
13% increase.  
Similarly, multiple analyses of long-term, quality-controlled weather station data show increases in the 
observed frequency of 1- and 2-inch precipitation events across New York. For days with at least 1 inch, 
analysis by the assessment team found significant (p < 0.05) increases in frequency over the entire period of 
record available at seven out of nine individual weather stations that were used for this assessment and had 
data back to at least the 1950s (and in some cases, much earlier).12 Analysis of the same stations found two 
sites with significant increases in days with at least 2 inches.12 Looking at the period since the 1950s and using 
additional data, the NRCC found increases in the frequency of 2-inch precipitation events and the occurrence 
of storms previously considered once in 100-year events across New York and New England.40 Evidence that 
severe rainstorms can lead to flooding is intuitive but also documented widely in the literature, case studies, 
and popular media.

57 
The projections developed for this assessment show strong agreement that total precipitation will increase 
progressively through the 21st century in every region of New York State. By the 2080s, precipitation is 
projected to be 6% to 17% higher than it was during the 1981–2010 baseline. This assessment’s projections 
also show days with 1 inch and 2 inches of precipitation becoming more frequent at all 19 stations modeled, 
and they show the most extreme events modeled (4 or more inches in a day) becoming more frequent at 12 
of the 19 stations by the 2080s. As noted in the traceable account for Key Finding 1, these projections use the 
most advanced GCMs currently available (the CMIP6 suite), which reflect the state of the science in global 
climate modeling and have been used in the most recent IPCC global assessment1 and the Fifth National 
Climate Assessment.2 The direction of change is consistent across every available CMIP6 climate model under 
both emissions scenarios that bound the likely range used for this assessment (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The 
projections presented here are consistent with a long series of projections showing increased total and heavy 
precipitation in the northeastern United States over the 21st century, including projections in the Fifth National 
Climate Assessment’s “Northeast” chapter.204 From a seasonal perspective, the Fourth National Climate 
Assessment took a closer look and projected that the largest increases in precipitation in the Northeast will 
occur in winter and spring.16 This assessment’s newer, New York-focused modeling yielded similar results, with 
all models agreeing that winter and spring will experience increasingly more precipitation compared with the 
1981–2010 baseline. The models do not agree on the direction of change for summer and fall. This 
assessment’s modeled percentage increases are higher for winter than for spring, though the likely ranges (as 
defined for this assessment) overlap. 
Projections of future snowfall come from multiple modeling studies documented in the scientific 
literature.16,48,49 The Fourth National Climate Assessment cited several studies in concluding that the Northeast 
overall will receive less early-season snow, an increasing share of winter precipitation falling as rain, and a 
shorter snow season.16 Earlier modeling by Kunkel et al. (2002) showed a mechanism by which lake-effect 
snow could be the exception to this trend, with increases projected over the next few decades as a result of 
warmer water and decreased ice cover on the Great Lakes.49 Further research has corroborated this 
connection, noting several ways in which ice cover reduces evaporation175 and projecting ongoing declines in 
Great Lakes ice cover.157 However, Kunkel et al. (2002) projected more lake-effect rain instead of snow by 
later in the 21st century.49 This conclusion is supported by newer downscaled modeling tailored to the Great 
Lakes region, which projected reduced frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms throughout most of the 
Great Lakes basin by the late 21st century.48 This finding is consistent with the Fourth National Climate 
Assessment, which concluded about the Great Lakes in general: “As the warming in the Midwest continues, 
reductions in lake ice may increase the frequency of lake-effect snows until winters become so warm that 
snowfall events shift to rain.”205 The same recent study that modeled lake-effect snow for the Great Lakes 
basin also projected that New York as a whole will receive 20 to more than 50 fewer inches of snowfall per 
year (a loss reported in the original source as 50 to more than 130 centimeters) in 2080–2099, compared with 
1980–1999.48  
The projection of reduced snowpack comes from the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which assessed the 
literature and found wide agreement that reduced snowfall and warmer winter temperatures overall in the 
Northeast during the 21st century will also correspond with reduced depth and water equivalent of snow on 
the ground.16 
New Information and Remaining Uncertainties  
The width of the ranges given for each of the projections cited here results in part from the fundamental 
uncertainty about which greenhouse gas emissions trajectory the world will follow most closely. As with 
temperature, this uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of future changes in precipitation with 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
58 
high precision. However, the overall direction of change toward more total precipitation and more frequent 
heavy storms is projected to be the same regardless of where actual greenhouse gas emissions fall within the 
likely range. 
Although the climate models show confidence in projected increases in winter and spring precipitation, the 
models have too much disagreement and uncertainty to conclude whether precipitation will increase or 
decrease during summer and fall. Due to resolution constraints, the models cannot simulate many of the 
relevant storm types that deliver precipitation to New York, including hurricanes, mesoscale convective 
systems, or even frontal systems. 
Future trends in lake-effect snowfall are somewhat uncertain because seasonal warming drives two opposing 
effects: it adds moisture to the atmosphere and increases storm formation (warmer air and water, less ice 
cover to constrain evaporation) but it can also warm the air above the freezing point and cause more 
precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. In simple terms, whether lake-effect snowfall will increase or 
decrease in New York will depend on which of these effects dominates. Modeling suggests that lake-effect 
snowfall will increase in the nearer term but decrease in the longer term as air temperatures become 
increasingly too warm for snow, but the magnitude of change and the timing of the switch from increase to 
decrease remains uncertain. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence  
There is very high confidence in the observed and projected changes in total annual precipitation and heavy 
precipitation events, given the preponderance of observed evidence from widespread long-term monitoring, 
agreement among all models and climate scenarios regarding the direction of future change in these variables, 
and consistency with highly confident findings from authoritative national assessments. 
There is high confidence in the projection that precipitation will increase the most in winter. While the results 
for any given model, scenario, and assessment region largely show winter precipitation increasing more 
dramatically than the next closest season—spring—the aggregation across models and scenarios yields wide 
“likely ranges” that largely overlap between the two seasons. 
Overall, the portions of this key finding that relate to snowfall can be given high confidence. As reflected in 
authoritative national assessments and other literature, models offer widespread agreement that winter 
temperatures in New York will warm, an increasing share of winter precipitation will fall as rain, the snow 
season will become shorter, and there will be less snow accumulating and persisting on the ground. There is 
also strong agreement that conditions known to promote lake-effect precipitation—warmer air and water, 
reduced ice cover—will become more prevalent over time. However, the way these effects will translate into 
total snowfall can only be assessed with high (not very high) confidence because of likely regional differences 
and inherent uncertainties in the relative strength of opposing effects. Specifically, there is a question of when 
and where the increase in winter precipitation driven by climate change (especially by warming of large lakes) 
will actually result in more snowfall, which depends on the extent to which temperatures warm above freezing 
at a given time and place. That said, multiple studies using different models have concurred that lake-effect 
snowfall in New York will likely increase in the near term before declining in the longer term. 
Key Finding 3 
Climate change is creating conditions that will increase the frequency and severity of many types 
of extreme events. Several types of storms are expected to become more intense, with heavier rainfall, 
stronger winds, and higher storm surge along the coast driven by sea level rise. Short-term summer droughts 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
59 
could increase due to changing precipitation patterns and increased temperatures. Wildfires are unlikely to 
become much more common within New York State due to climate change, but air quality impacts from large 
fires elsewhere in North America could increase in the future.  
Description of Evidence Base  
The first part of this key finding refers to climate conditions that influence extreme events. The conditions in 
question are largely fundamental climate variables discussed throughout this chapter, with observed changes 
supported by long-term, quality-controlled measurement programs. Projections of ongoing change are 
supported by downscaled modeling conducted for this assessment using the best climate models currently 
available (the CMIP6 suite). These models reflect the state of the science in global climate modeling and have 
been used in the most recent IPCC global assessment1 and the Fifth National Climate Assessment.2 The 
following evidence supports the assertion that climate conditions that influence extreme events are changing 
in New York: 
 Air temperatures influence storm formation and intensity, drought, and wildfire risk, all through 
widely established and reasonably intuitive mechanisms. In simple terms, higher air temperatures 
increase evaporation, feed storms with more moisture and energy, and increase drying on the ground 
through both evapotranspiration and earlier snowmelt that can leave less moisture on the ground by 
summer. As discussed in the traceable account for Key Finding 1, analysis of quality-controlled long-
term weather station records shows a highly significant increase in average annual air temperatures 
from 1901 to 2022 statewide14 and significant increases from 1901 to 2020 at 24 out of 27 individual 
weather stations examined as part of this assessment. Similarly, the projections developed for this 
assessment using state-of-the-art GCMs show strong agreement that annual mean temperatures, mean 
temperatures in all seasons, and extreme temperatures will continue to increase in all regions of New 
York. These results are consistent with the body of evidence summarized in authoritative global and 
national climate assessments.1,2  
 Water temperatures in large water bodies like the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes influence 
storm formation and intensity. Warmer waters feed storms with more moisture (evaporation) and 
energy.  
As noted below in the traceable account for Key Finding 4 on New York’s coastal waters, studies based 
on satellite and in situ data show consistent agreement that sea surface temperatures have warmed 
significantly at many spatial scales relevant to New York.107,111–114 Sea surface temperature has 
increased worldwide and throughout the Atlantic since 1901,107 which is relevant to New York because 
the state experiences tropical cyclones that form over warmer waters far to the south. Modeled 
projections from the literature agree that sea surface temperature will continue to warm through the 
21st century, both worldwide and in waters near New York, under multiple climate scenarios.108,115  
Surface waters of Lakes Erie and Ontario warmed significantly (p < 0.05) from 1995 to 2022, based on 
a comprehensive satellite-based data set developed and maintained by NOAA,154 with analysis following 
an approach published by EPA.143 The Fourth and Fifth National Climate Assessments cite multiple 
additional studies that concur that the Great Lakes have warmed.205,206 Projections from a regional 
climate model optimized for the Great Lakes show surface water temperatures continuing to increase.157 
This finding is consistent with widespread projections of continued warming of air, water, and land at 
the Earth’s surface.1,2 
 Precipitation influences drought and wildfire risk. Seasonal deficits can be important, especially when 
combined with rising temperatures that increase evapotranspiration. As documented in the traceable 
account for Key Finding 2, analysis of records from long-term, quality-controlled weather stations shows 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
60 
that total annual precipitation increased to a statistically significant degree across much of New York 
State from 1901 to 2020. Weather station data show significant increases statewide from 1901 to 2022 
in summer and fall precipitation.14 Projections developed for this assessment using state-of-the-art 
CMIP6 GCMs show strong agreement across models and climate scenarios that total annual precipitation 
will increase progressively through the 21st century in every region of New York State. The direction of 
change is consistent across every available CMIP6 climate model under both emissions scenarios that 
bound the likely range used for this assessment (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The projections presented 
here are consistent with a long series of projections showing increased total precipitation in the 
northeastern United States over the 21st century, including projections in the Fourth National Climate 
Assessment’s “Northeast” chapter.16 From a seasonal perspective, the Fourth National Climate 
Assessment projected that the largest increases in precipitation in the Northeast will occur in winter and 
spring.16 This assessment’s newer, New York-focused modeling yielded similar results, with all models 
agreeing that winter and spring will bring increasingly more precipitation compared with the 1981–2010 
baseline. 
 Sea level influences storm surge. As sea level rises relative to the shore, it provides a higher base 
elevation onto which storm surge is added, leading to storm surge that can reach farther inland and 
cause more destruction. This effect is exacerbated as storms themselves become more intense under 
the warming conditions described above, with stronger winds driving higher surge. Evidence of 
observed change comes from tide gauges operated by NOAA, which have measured sea level relative to 
the shore since 1856 in New York City (The Battery) and since 1947 at Montauk. Both locations have 
experienced a steady and highly statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in relative sea level over 
time.9 Projections come from modeling conducted for this assessment, which projected further sea level 
rise along the New York State coastline and in the tidal Hudson throughout the 21st century and beyond 
under both scenarios analyzed. These locally downscaled projections are consistent with NOAA’s official 
projections updated in 2022121 and further supported by the scientific community’s recognition that 
much future sea level has already been “locked in” as a result of continuing deep-ocean warming and 
ice-sheet melt driven by global warming that has already taken place.1,2 The observations and 
projections described here are consistent with widespread reporting of observed and projected global 
and regional sea level rise in the global and national assessment literature, with the IPCC’s Sixth 
Assessment categorizing observed sea level rise as “high confidence” and continued rise through the 
21st century as “virtually certain.”1,2 
 Projections of “fire weather” indices under the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), using 
regional climate models for the northeastern and Great Lakes states, show modest but significant 
increases through the year 2100 in weather conditions that are conducive to wildfire ignition and 
spread.105 
Projected increases in storm intensity are consistent with the expected influence of warmer air and water. 
They come from several sources: 
 Heavy precipitation projections developed for this assessment using the best available suite of GCMs, 
showing that days with 1 inch or 2 inches of rainfall are projected to become more frequent at all 19 
stations included in this analysis, and that by the 2080s, days with at least 4 inches are also projected 
to become more frequent at 12 of the 19 stations. 
 Agreement in the literature that tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic will become stronger on average 
over time, with more intense wind and rain.62–64 The Fourth National Climate Assessment echoed this 
conclusion.61 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
61 
 Projections from 10 CMIP5 models suggesting that East Coast extratropical cyclones could become more 
intense and 5% to 25% wetter in the future.66  
The projected increase in storm surge height, and therefore in destructive potential, reflects expert judgment 
based on the fact that its two primary physical drivers—sea level and coastal storm intensity—have both been 
projected with confidence to increase, as described above. This association is supported by literature.122 
Attribution studies provide corroborating evidence that rising sea level due to climate change increased the 
flooding associated with a large coastal storm.58  
The finding that short-term summer droughts could increase in frequency or intensity in the future reflects 
expert judgment in considering the relative contributions of temperature and precipitation—the two 
fundamental drivers of drought that can be modeled with the most confidence. Projections developed for this 
assessment indicate that temperatures will increase throughout New York in all seasons (see the traceable 
account for Key Finding 1). Literature has connected this warming to earlier snowmelt in the Northeast, which 
can lead to more drying of soils by summer.86 In contrast, there is disagreement among the CMIP6 GCMs used 
for this assessment as to whether summer precipitation will increase or decrease in New York during the 21st 
century. Taken together, this information suggests a reasonable possibility that the factors that increase 
drought (warmer air leading to more evapotranspiration; earlier snowmelt leading to more drying by summer) 
will outweigh those that decrease it (additional precipitation). 
Projections related to wildfire come from a collection of independent studies published in the scientific 
literature, three of which focused on New York and the Northeast. Two of these studies examined wildfire risk 
in New York and reached essentially the same conclusion: that the state’s probability of fire occurrence will 
remain close to zero, even with a percentage-wise increase over time.103,104 A third noted that the length of the 
fire season in the Northeast will begin earlier in the year, peak earlier, and last longer.105 Many other studies 
have examined wildfires more broadly over North America (e.g., Burke at al., 2021)106 and noted that the 
increased probability of large fires elsewhere could increase the risk of air quality impacts far from the source. 
The Fifth National Climate Assessment207,208 and the USGCRP’s 2016 Climate and Health Assessment209 both 
support these conclusions, as they emphasize large projected increases in wildfire occurrence in certain 
regions (e.g., the West, Alaska) and describe a corresponding deterioration of air quality as a problem that can 
extend far downwind. 
New Information and Remaining Uncertainties  
Among factors that contribute to extreme events, wind is an important component of “fire weather.” 
Projections of future changes in wind speeds remain generally uncertain. Another uncertain factor is lightning, 
which ignites many wildfires. Projections in the literature disagree as to whether the frequency of lightning 
strikes will increase or decrease in a warming climate.70–73  
Storm formation processes also continue to have some uncertainty. Such processes can be complex, and they 
remain the subject of ongoing study. Projections of some types of severe storm events, including tornadoes, 
hail, and derechos, are not readily available.4 Ice storm projections are inconclusive.74 While some other storm 
types have reasonably confident projections of increased intensity, there remain uncertainties regarding 
frequency. Scientific literature suggests that the total number of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic could 
stay the same or perhaps decrease slightly61,62 and that fewer hurricanes could make landfall along the 
northeastern U.S. coast.65 There is also some question as to whether extratropical cyclones such as nor’easters 
will become more frequent.66  
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
62 
Projections of increased late-summer, short-term droughts acknowledge the uncertainty in the underlying 
precipitation projections. While there is very high confidence that temperatures will increase in all seasons (see 
traceable account for Key Finding 1), and high confidence in earlier snowmelt (see traceable account for Key 
Finding 2), other contributing factors are less certain. As the traceable account for Key Finding 2 notes, the 
GCMs used for this assessment’s modeling disagree on whether total summer precipitation in New York State 
will increase. Even if summer precipitation does increase, it is not certain whether the increase will be 
sufficient to offset increased evapotranspiration due to warmer air. Direct modeling of future drought index 
values remains challenging given that results can vary widely depending on one’s choice of drought index,210 
and given the known limitations of relying on temperature-based proxies for soil moisture.211 
Wildfires are not well represented by climate models, as their occurrence and magnitude depend on a 
confluence of factors—some environmental, some human. Within New York State, Figure 2-19 and associated 
historical records show readily how much wildfire frequency and extent can be influenced by fire prevention 
and suppression activities. Modeling and analysis therefore tend to focus more on projecting specific conditions 
(i.e., warm, dry “fire weather”) that have a documented relationship to wildfire activity. Application of coarse 
spatial models at the local forest scale is uncertain,102 suggesting an opportunity for more focused 
investigations that consider variation in factors that affect wildfire risk, such as soil moisture and wind. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence  
This key finding starts with underlying conditions because that is where confidence is arguably the highest. 
There is very high confidence that core climate conditions that influence extreme events have changed in 
New York and are continuing to change. Observed changes in air temperature, ocean and Great Lakes surface 
water temperature, total and seasonal precipitation, and sea level are supported by a preponderance of 
observed evidence from widespread long-term monitoring. There is agreement among authoritative national 
and global assessments, other literature, and this assessment’s modeling regarding the direction of future 
change in mean and extreme temperatures; annual, winter, and spring precipitation; and sea level. Other 
assessments and studies also agree that ocean and Great Lakes surface water temperatures will continue to 
increase. 
Storms are one type of extreme event that can be influenced by these conditions. Storm formation is complex 
and depends on many factors, so it cannot be projected with as much confidence as a more fundamental 
variable such as temperature. Nonetheless, there is high confidence that several types of storms will become 
more intense during the 21st century. Although models disagree about projected changes in the frequency of 
storms, the literature suggests broad agreement among models and researchers that climate conditions will 
favor the formation of tropical and extratropical cyclones with more intense wind and rain, as well as more 
heavy rain and snowstorms in general. 
Despite the complexity associated with storm intensity, there is very high confidence that storm surge will 
increase in height and therefore in destructive potential. The physical mechanisms at play are simple and well 
established. Increased storm intensity (high confidence) would lead to more destructive storm surge on its 
own, as would increased sea level (very high confidence). The fact that both factors are projected to increase 
simultaneously leaves little room to doubt that storm surge will also increase in severity. 
There is medium confidence that short-term summer droughts will increase in likelihood or severity. This 
assessment acknowledges that while there is relatively high confidence in projections of certain drivers of 
drought, such as warmer summer temperatures and drying associated with earlier snowmelt, climate models 
disagree on the direction of change in summer precipitation. 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
63 
There is medium confidence that wildfires are unlikely to become much more common within New York 
State. Two studies cited in this assessment reached this conclusion independently, but wildfires are difficult to 
model, and more definitive assessments on this matter are limited. Moreover, the events of 2023, including 
record-setting fires throughout eastern Canada (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia), suggest at least empirically 
that the relatively wetter parts of North America are not immune to substantial wildfire activity. Nonetheless, 
there is very high confidence that air quality impacts from larger fires elsewhere in North America could 
increase in the future, as there is widespread agreement in the literature that fires elsewhere in areas such as 
the western United States and Canada are likely to increase in extent and severity, along with empirical 
evidence that larger fires generally lead to higher particulate matter concentrations downwind—including as 
far away as New York State. 
Key Finding 4 
Sea surface temperature, sea level, and coastal flooding are increasing along New York State’s 
coast. Sea surface temperatures are rising more rapidly in the state than the global average. Sea level along 
New York’s coastline has risen almost 1 foot in the past century and is projected to increase by another 1 to 2 
feet by mid-century, making chronic flooding more common in low-lying coastal neighborhoods. Ocean water 
is also becoming more acidic as it absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, although stormwater 
runoff currently has a larger effect on acidity in New York’s coastal waters. 
Description of Evidence Base  
Studies based on satellite and in situ data show consistent agreement that sea surface temperatures have 
warmed significantly at many spatial scales relevant to New York.107,111–114 Several of these studies focused on 
the period from 1982 forward, finding linear regression slopes at least three times the global average slope 
during a similar time frame.16,212 Modeled projections from the literature agree that sea surface temperature 
will continue to warm through the 21st century, both worldwide and in waters near New York, under multiple 
climate scenarios.108,115  
Evidence of observed change in sea level comes from tide gauges operated by NOAA, which have measured 
sea level relative to the shore elevation since 1856 in New York City (The Battery) and since 1947 at Montauk. 
Both locations have experienced a steady and highly statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in sea level 
over time.9 The assertion that this rise has amounted to nearly a foot in the last century is based on the linear 
regression line of best fit for each site. The Battery’s long-term rate of change from 1856 to 2022 is an 
average of 0.11 inches (2.90 millimeters) per year, or 11 inches per 100 years. The actual total change over 
the most recent 100 years is potentially more than 11 inches, given evidence of nonlinearity (specifically, 
recent acceleration) noted in New York9 and worldwide.1 From this perspective, “almost 1 foot” is a 
conservative statement. Montauk’s regression slope of 0.14 inches (3.43 millimeters) per year from 1947 to 
2022 indicates an increase of 10.5 inches over 75 years, but one cannot assume that the same rate of change 
preceded 1947, so the evidence justifies “almost 1 foot” but not more. 
Projections of future sea level come from modeling conducted for this assessment, which projected further sea 
level rise along the New York State coastline and in the tidal Hudson throughout the 21st century and beyond 
under all scenarios analyzed. The assertion of a further 1- to 2-foot increase by mid-century is based on 
ranges of 15–21 inches at Montauk, 14–19 inches at The Battery, and 12–17 inches at Albany in the 2050s, 
relative to a 1995–2014 baseline. The ranges given here represent the 25th to 75th percentiles of a blended 
set of three scenarios used by the IPCC: SSP2-4.5 with medium confidence, SSP5-8.5 with medium 
confidence, and SSP5-8.5 with low confidence—the latter reflecting the potential for low-probability but high-
impact events associated with rapid ice loss. These locally downscaled projections are consistent with NOAA’s 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
64 
official projections updated in 2022121 and are based on CMIP6 models and the projections developed for the 
IPCC’s Sixth Assessment, along with the latest advances in process understanding, improved and lengthened 
observational records, and improved ice-sheet modeling. Projected increases also reflect the scientific 
community’s recognition that much future sea level has already been “locked in” as a result of continuing 
deep-ocean warming and ice-sheet melt driven by global warming that has already taken place.1 The 
observations and projections described here are consistent with widespread reporting of observed and 
projected global and regional sea level rise in the global and national assessment literature, with the IPCC’s 
Sixth Assessment categorizing observed sea level rise as “high confidence” and continued rise through the 
21st century as “virtually certain.”1,2 
Evidence of increased coastal flooding comes from measurements collected at three long-term tide gauge 
stations—The Battery, Kings Point, and Montauk—and analyzed from 1950 forward. This approach represents 
an objective way to characterize coastal flooding trends, as it relies on precise measurements recorded every 
six minutes and compared against a fixed “nuisance flooding” threshold that NOAA has established for each 
location based on its historical record.122 The resulting numbers characterize the total number of days per year 
when each location experienced water levels above the threshold, meaning they can include major storm 
surge flooding as well as “sunny day” high-tide flooding exacerbated by sea level rise. At all three locations, 
such events occurred two to five times more often during the period 2010–2022 as they did during 1950–
1969, in terms of average annual frequency.123,124 It is also possible to find observations from specific 
neighborhoods, anecdotal evidence, and descriptions of the areal extent or impact of coastal flooding, but the 
assertion of a change over time here is based on the systematic long-term collection of data at tide gauges. 
Projections of more frequent coastal flooding, including chronic flooding in low-lying neighborhoods, are based 
on a combination of modeling and mapping. Modeling comes from NOAA, whose most recent authoritative 
projections of future coastal flooding are tied to their 2022 sea level rise projections, modeled for the same 
tide gauge locations.124 Projections of increased flooding along with sea level rise are both intuitive and 
consistent with national assessments,213 particularly considering that New York’s coastal lands are known to be 
subsiding, which exacerbates the problem.116 Projections of more frequent chronic flooding in low-lying 
neighborhoods in the future reflect the magnitude of NOAA’s projections (50–90 days per year across the 
three New York sites by 2041–2050, reflecting the range from NOAA’s low to intermediate scenarios),124 digital 
elevation mapping of low-lying areas such as has been reported by the New York City Panel on Climate 
Change,59,60 and anecdotal reports that some of New York’s coastal neighborhoods experience flooding even 
before an official flood threshold is reached.119 
The assertion that ocean water is becoming more acidic as it absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere is a global statement based on observed data and scientific studies assessed by authoritative 
bodies including the IPCC and USGCRP.1,2 Evidence that stormwater runoff currently has a larger effect than 
atmospheric carbon dioxide on acidity in New York’s coastal waters comes from a literature review compiled by 
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which cited a set of association studies.136 
 
New Information and Remaining Uncertainties  
Projections of future sea level rise continue to improve as scientists advance their understanding of dynamic, 
nonlinear processes, particularly those that relate to ice sheets and glaciers and the potential for rapid ice loss 
in the future. The ARIM scenario developed for the 2019 New York City Panel on Climate Change report 
represents such a high-impact, low-probability future event.117 Several recent studies (e.g., Slangen et al., 
2017214) confirm the plausibility of high-end sea level rise scenarios resulting from rapid ice melt. This 
assessment attempted to account for this possibility by including an “SSP5-8.5-low confidence” scenario when 
generating the ranges shown in Table 2-3, but doing so leads to relatively wide ranges, particularly for the 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
65 
later part of the time frame. Moreover, some plausible outcomes lie beyond the upper bounds presented in 
Table 2-3. 
Systematic observed measurements of acidity are relatively limited in New York’s coastal waters, and acidity 
(e.g., pH) was not among the variables modeled for this assessment. The mechanism by which increased 
carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere drive acidification is unquestioned basic science, but other 
factors also contribute to acidity in specific coastal areas. The interplay of these factors and the ability to 
model their relative contributions could benefit from further study.  
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence  
There is very high confidence that sea surface temperature, sea level, and coastal flooding have increased 
historically and will continue to increase during the 21st century as described in this key finding. This 
assessment of confidence reflects the strength of evidence, with complete agreement across observational 
data sets and models regarding the direction of change, wide concurrence in the scientific literature (including 
previous assessments), and alignment with well-established scientific mechanisms. 
There is very high confidence that the world’s oceans have and will continue to become more acidic as 
carbon dioxide concentrations increase in the atmosphere. This is another fundamental scientific relationship, 
with supporting observations established throughout the literature. Because of limited data and because other 
factors can affect acidity on a local scale, however, there is not enough evidence presented here to assess 
carbon dioxide-driven acidification specifically in New York. The assertion that stormwater runoff has a larger 
influence than carbon dioxide on acidification in New York’s coastal waters is presented with medium 
confidence, as it is based on observed patterns and documented correlations between acidity and nitrogen for 
specific water bodies, but not a formal attribution study.  
Key Finding 5 
New York State’s lakes and rivers have experienced increased water temperature, fluctuating 
water levels, and decreased ice cover, and these changes are expected to intensify in a warmer, 
wetter future. Lakes are projected to experience more severe summer heat waves and decreased winter ice 
cover as temperatures rise in the coming decades. The Great Lakes could experience greater year-to-year 
variability in water levels, driven by periods of drought and extreme precipitation. Flood intensity and damages 
are expected to increase with extreme rainfall and broader changes in streamflow. 
Description of Evidence Base  
Evidence of observed change in various attributes of New York’s lakes and rivers comes from a variety of 
measurement programs:  
 For surface water temperature, lines of evidence include satellite-based measurement of surface 
water temperatures in the Great Lakes154 (Lakes Erie and Ontario warmed from 1995 to 2022—
significant to a 95% confidence level following methods published by EPA143) and a standardized 
analysis of in situ data for the Northeast that included 15 smaller lakes in New York (14 of 15 
experienced surface warming since 1975 or 1985, depending on when data collection started, and the 
overall trend across lakes in the region was significant to a 95% level).146 These results are consistent 
with continental and global-scale studies that have documented widespread warming of lakes at 
temperate latitudes.147,152 An increase in stream temperatures is inferred from measured data in 
neighboring states149 and statistical relationships with air temperature.150 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2 
Interim Version for Public Release 
 
66 
 Water levels are based on long-term gauging records for the Great Lakes, measured consistently since 
1860. The data show fluctuations over time, with some record highs since 2015, but there is still much 
variation in the data set.143 Thus, the assertion in this key finding is more a general recognition that 
water levels have fluctuated over time, and should not be taken to indicate a definitive long-term trend 
for both of New York’s Great Lakes or for any other specific lakes in New York. 
 Statistically significant changes in ice cover in lakes have been detected by several independent long-
term monitoring efforts, ranging from comprehensive daily and weekly ice mapping of the Great Lakes 
since 1973 (observations from ships, shore, aircraft, and satellites)173 to more than a century of 
shoreline observer records for Lake Champlain, Otsego Lake, Lake George, and additional smaller lakes 
in the Adirondacks.170–172 All significant changes in ice cover extent or duration have been decreases.  
Evidence that many of these changes are expected to intensify comes from a variety of projections published 
in the literature. For example, evidence of future warming in New York’s lakes comes from regionally 
downscaled climate modeling. Results include surface warming of all Great Lakes under two climate 
scenarios;157 warming of Oneida Lake—the largest lake entirely within New York—under two climate 
scenarios;156 and corroborating evidence from global studies and the prior work they cite.153 River and stream 
water temperatures could be expected to increase, too, but this assertion relies on association with air 
temperature (a predictive variable) and not direct modeling of water temperatures.  
The projected increase in severe summer heat waves in lakes is based on a global modeling analysis.153 This 
analysis shows a large change, from an average of 8 heat wave days per year (over the period 1970–1999) to 
about 96 days by the end of this century. Applicability of this finding to New York is based on the assessment 
team’s judgment, given (1) the strong projections of continued warming in New York’s lakes (which would 
likely shift the entire temperature distribution, including the tails, just as the shifting distribution of air 
temperatures makes extreme events more common); (2) that lakes in the northeastern United States have 
warmed as quickly as or more quickly than those in other mid-latitude regions of the world;146 and (3) 
projections of increased duration of warm-season stratification in New York lakes,156,157 which exacerbates heat 
waves as it traps heat in the upper portion of the water column.215 
Projections of decreased winter ice cover on New York’s lakes come from regionally downscaled climate 
modeling for the Great Lakes and for smaller lakes such as Lower Saint Regis Lake in the Adirondacks.157,171 
These models show wide agreement that lakes will experience reduced ice cover as winter temperatures 
increase under multiple climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 for the Great Lakes; SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 
for Lower Saint Regis Lake). As noted in the traceable account for Key Finding 1, there is very high confidence 
that winter air temperatures will increase in New York. 
Climate modeling is inconclusive as to whether Great Lakes water levels will increase or decrease over the 
decades ahead. Therefore, this key finding avoids suggesting a direction of change and instead reports what 
many models generally agree upon, which is that annual and multiyear variability in Great Lakes water levels 
will increase. Models suggest that “prolonged periods of both high and low levels” will become more 
common.181 The mechanism for such an increase in variability is conceivable given the general tendency of 
climate change to exacerbate extremes, including periods of relative drought and extreme precipitation 
events.179 Seasonal differences in projected precipitation and runoff could increase variability at a seasonal 
scale.186,189 
The assertion that flood intensity and damages are expected to increase with extreme rainfall reflects general 
agreement among a variety of modeling studies. These studies include projections for winter river flows and 
inland flooding in the northeastern United States,165 a combination of lake seiche and high river flows along 
 New York State Climate Impacts Assessment: Chapter 2

67 
Great Lakes shorelines,166 a doubling of projected financial damages from flooding across most regions of the 
United States associated with warming that this assessment projects to occur by mid-century,163 and 
downscaled projections of inland flood damages that show increases for parts of New York.164 However, the 
latter study projects decreases for other parts of New York. Projected increases in fluvial flooding align with 
projections of increased annual stream discharge and higher winter streamflows in particular.35 
New Information and Remaining Uncertainties  
Observed trends in certain parameters for New York’s lakes and rivers remain inconclusive or have limited 
data. For example, while individual lake temperatures across New York State are regularly monitored by 
government agencies, academic organizations, and individuals via programs such as the Citizens Statewide 
Lake Assessment Program, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of these data. As noted above, time-
series analysis of temperature data for relatively unmodified streams is also limited—a possible opportunity for 
further study. Increases in inland flooding have been noted anecdotally, but statistical analysis is limited. In 
one analysis based on stream gauge data, only one of 10 New York sites had a statistically significant increase 
in flood magnitude—and none in frequency—from 1965 to 2015.158 
Projections of stream temperatures have some uncertainty as they may be inferred from projections of air 
temperature. Increased streamflow associated with increased precipitation could offset some of this warming 
effect.149  
Projections of future water levels in the Great Lakes are limited due to the difficulty of simulating land–air–lake 
processes and the high spatial resolution needed to generate accurate estimates.179,181 Thus, there is no 
scientific consensus as to whether lake levels will increase or decrease overall.181 The more recent evidence 
discussed in section 7.4 suggests a tendency toward higher water levels through the middle of this century, 
but that evidence still comes with appreciable uncertainties, along with the caveat that Lake Ontario’s water 
levels are also influenced by downstream hydromodifications (namely, the Moses-Saunders dam) that regulate 
outflow from the lake. More generally, it could take several more years to achieve standardized approaches to 
model Great Lakes processes, including ice cover. 
Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence  
There is very high confidence that lakes in New York have warmed, will continue to warm in the decades 
ahead, and will experience more severe summer heat waves. Observed changes are supported by a 
preponderance of evidence showing statistically significant surface warming across large and small lakes 
throughout New York. Future projections reflect agreement across multiple studies and scenarios. These 
findings align with widely reported regional and global trends, and their fundamental connection to air 
temperature (which is also increasing with very high confidence, as discussed in Key Finding 1) is well 
established. 
There is medium confidence that stream temperatures in New York have increased and will increase in the 
future. While an association with rising air temperatures has been established scientifically, analysis of direct 
observations and projections for stream temperatures in New York is limited, and the extent to which 
increased streamflow could offset the warming effect of air temperature is uncertain. 
There is very high confidence that winter ice cover in New York lakes has declined and will continue to do so 
in the decades ahead. Although observed ice cover trends are indeterminate for certain portions of the Great 
Lakes when characterized in certain ways (e.g., maximum annual ice cover extent), most evidence points to 
declining ice cover duration across lakes in many parts of the state, including much of Lake Ontario. This

direction of change is consistent across many independent monitoring efforts, some dating back more than a 
century. Projections of further loss reflect complete agreement across climate models, and their fundamental 
connection to air temperature (which is also increasing with very high confidence) is well established. 
There is medium confidence that water levels in the Great Lakes will increase in variability. This conclusion 
comes from recent downscaled modeling, and it comes with a plausible explanation given the tendency of 
climate change to exacerbate extremes in wetness and drought. However, modeling of Great Lakes water 
levels is admittedly more uncertain than the modeling for other phenomena discussed here, with models 
notably disagreeing on the overall direction of change. Thus, it would seem prudent to exercise some caution 
in interpreting any modeling related to Great Lakes water levels, and this portion of the finding is qualified with 
the word “could.” 
There is high confidence that flood intensity and damages will increase during the 21st century. Such a 
conclusion is arguably intuitive when coupled with this assessment’s projection of more frequent and intense 
heavy precipitation events (Key Finding 2; very high confidence). It is also supported by multiple modeling 
studies and other authoritative assessment literature. However, at least one study projects decreasing 
damages for sizable portions of New York,164 particularly with temperature changes anticipated for the first 
half of this century.
