1. Introduction  
Since the first ClimAID report in 2011, it has become clear that a changing climate is already causing 
major impacts in New York State. It is also now evident that if global greenhouse gas emissions are not 
cut dramatically, some climate change impacts in the state may exceed the capacity to adapt.  
This statewide knowledge is anchored in the changes observed at global and national scales. The 2010s 
was the warmest decade on record globally. Since reliable recordkeeping began late in the 19th century, 
the warmest years globally have all occurred since 2005, with 9 of the 10 warmest years occurring since 
2011 (IPCC, 2021). The year 2012 saw a record drop in summer arctic sea ice extent, far exceeding 
climate model projections, and 18% below the previous lowest record low in 2007 (NOAA, 2012). Recent 
years have seen unprecedented heat waves globally and, in the U.S., heat that has been associated with 
severe impacts including excess mortality of people and animals, severe forest fires, and crop losses. 
Meanwhile, extreme precipitation events and coastal flooding pose an increasing menace across many 
populous land areas globally and nationally. In 2020 alone, a record number of events (22) that caused 
more than a billion dollars in damages occurred (Smith, 2021). Indeed, the wave of extreme events of 
unprecedented frequency and intensity has helped engender a growing branch of climate science 
focused on attributing recent events to emissions that have already occurred (Burger et. Al 2020). It is 
clearer than ever that climate change and its impacts are already here.  
This realization has led to new urgency to not exceed global temperature and emissions targets, such as 
1.5°C (2.7°F) of global warming relative to preindustrial conditions. Warming above 1.5°C, for example, 
could pose an existential threat to much of the world’s coral reefs and lead to irreversible changes in 
high-latitude regions (IPCC, 2018). A recent study found that further emissions of more than 420 
GtCO2—equivalent to 10 years of current emissions—would more likely than not lead to warming in 
excess of 1.5°C (Matthews et al. 2021). While there have been great advances in greenhouse gas 
emissions reductions, many spearheaded by New York State, it remains an open question whether these 
innovations will be fast enough to keep up with accelerating climate change impacts. It is also 
increasingly clear that New York State will be impacted by climate changes outside the state, through 
diverse mechanisms ranging from supply chain disruptions (Chee Wai and Wongsurawat, 2013), to 
pollution from western U.S. wildfires (Shrestha et al. 2022), to climate-influenced migration patterns 
(Raymond et al. 2020; Horton et al., 2021).  
Section 2 of this report summarizes the climate of New York State and describes the weather stations 
used and regions defined in the analyses throughout this report. Section 3 is a historical analysis of 
climate trends for key variables, by region and station. Section 4 begins with projection methods, 
followed by the projections of how climate change will modify climate metrics ranging from creeping 
changes in time-averaged conditions to the frequency of currently rare extreme events. The final section 
summarizes the findings, highlights key uncertainties, and proposes topics for future work. 
2. New York State Climatology  
2.1. Climate Description  
New York State experiences extreme geographical variations in climate due to the large latitudinal 
extent, elevation differences, and the influence of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Several 
climate variables are described below. 
3 
 
2.1.1. Average Temperature and Precipitation  
The climate of New York State is best described as humid continental, with some areas of New York City 
and Long Island classified as humid subtropical (Peel et al., 2007). Across the state, annual average 
temperatures, based on the 1981–2010 climate normals, range from approximately 42°F in the 
northernmost areas of the state to 52°F in the New York City metropolitan region. While the southern 
part of New York State is the warmest on average, coastal temperatures along the immediate shoreline 
are moderated in summer due to the influence of sea breezes (Figure 1).

Northeastern United States, Including New York State

Annual precipitation is generally evenly distributed across the year in most locations in New York State. 
Average annual precipitation is the greatest downwind of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie due to enhanced 
precipitation from the Great Lakes and along the coastal plain due to the influence of coastal storms in 
both the warm and cool season (Figure 2). Locations in these areas average approximately 46 inches per 
year1. In the relatively drier parts of New York, which include the west-central part of the state, annual 
average precipitation is closer to 35 inches per year2.

2.1.2. Snowfall  
Snowfall varies dramatically across New York State based on topography and the proximity to the Great 
Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 3). In parts of the Tug Hill Plateau downwind of Lake Ontario and 
western New York near Lake Erie, average annual snowfall exceeds 150 inches due to lake-effect snow. 
Closer to the coastal plain, the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean suppresses average annual 
snowfall to around 30 inches.

2.1.3. Extreme Events  
A variety of climate extremes affect locations across New York State. These include hot and cold days, 
heat waves, intense precipitation, and coastal flooding caused by tropical cyclones and extratropical 
cyclones, including nor’easters, which are storm systems that move along the Atlantic coast and are 
named based on the prevailing direction of the wind flow. In all locations, the number of extreme events 
from year to year is highly variable. 
2.1.3.1. Extreme Temperature and Heat Waves  
Extreme hot days and heat waves can be defined in multiple ways to reflect the diversity of conditions 
experienced across the different regions in New York State. Hot days and heat waves are most common 
from June through August, although temperatures can exceed 90°F as early as April and as late as 
October. The urban heat island further elevates temperature extremes in the New York City 
metropolitan region and, to a lesser extent, other highly populated regions of New York State. 
Specific hot-day metrics include individual days with maximum temperatures at or above thresholds 
such as 90°F or 95°F. For this report, heat waves are defined as three or more consecutive days with 
maximum temperatures at or above 90°F. 
Extreme cold days are also defined to reflect the state's regional climate variations. In the coldest parts 
of New York State, temperatures falling below 0°F are not uncommon. Lake Placid, for example, 
averages 30 days below 0°F each year. Farther south, temperatures falling below 0°F are rare. Since 
6 
 
1900, there have been 37 days at Central Park where the minimum temperature was at or below 0°F. 
However, only 9 of those days have occurred within the past 60 years.  
2.1.3.2. Extreme Precipitation and Flooding  
Inland areas across New York experience frequent (non-snow) precipitation, with a peak in intensity in 
the summer. Coastal areas in New York State typically experience fewer precipitation events. However, 
those events are often more intense and tend to peak in the late spring as well as early fall. (Agel et al., 
2015). This reflects the different mechanisms that can cause extreme precipitation, which include small-
scale thunderstorms, most common in the warmer months, and large-scale coastal storms in both the 
warm and cool seasons.  
Heavy precipitation can cause flooding in all seasons across New York State. In central and northern New 
York, flooding is most frequent in the spring, when rainfall and snowmelt lead to runoff. Farther south, 
inland flooding is more common during the summer. Larger river systems in New York State are at risk of 
flooding associated with the moisture from tropical cyclones. Along the coastal plain, flooding can be 
exacerbated by the combined effect of rainfall and coastal flooding. Urban environments face unique 
flood risks since the built environment limits absorption of water by underlying soils. In September 
2021, deadly flooding caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, which produced more than 3 inches of 
rain at Central Park in an hour—shattering by over 50% a record set just two weeks earlier—points to 
the severity of the risk.  
2.1.3.3. Extratropical and Tropical Cyclones  
The two types of storms with the largest impact on New York State are tropical cyclones and 
extratropical cyclones/nor’easters. Along the coast, these storms are responsible for large storm surge 
events, as well as a large percentage of the occurrences of other significant impacts that can extend far 
inland (e.g., high winds and extreme precipitation). Mid-latitude weather systems (extratropical 
cyclones) can approach the state from multiple directions, causing a variety of weather events, including 
thunderstorms, heavy rainfall, strong winds, and frozen precipitation (e.g., snow, sleet, and freezing 
rain). Tropical cyclones typically approach the region from the waters to the south. However, severe 
impacts can extend far inland, as evidenced by recent events such as Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm 
Lee in 2011, which brought heavy rainfall and flooding into inland areas of New York.  
Extratropical cyclones affect the state far more frequently than tropical cyclones and are of longer 
duration. They generally occur in the cool season (November through April) and are associated with 
smaller storm surges and weaker winds along the coast as compared to the strongest tropical cyclones. 
Nevertheless, nor’easter flood effects can be large, since their long duration can extend the period of 
high winds, high water, and wave action over multiple tidal cycles. Notable recent events include a 
series of nor’easters in early March 2018, which brought heavy precipitation (rainfall and snowfall), high 
winds, and coastal flooding in consecutive events. 
Landfalling tropical cyclones along the coast of New York State are uncommon, as prevailing westerly 
winds generally steer hurricanes away from the coast as the storms approach the northeastern United 
States. They generally impact the state in the warm season from July to October. The impacts of these 
storms are, in part, dependent on the track they take. Those that pass to the east of Long Island typically 
have higher wind speeds, especially for coastal locations. Those that make landfall over southeastern 
New York or track farther inland can produce heavy rainfall totals through central and western New 
York.  
 
7 
 
In July 2021, Tropical Storm Elsa made landfall over Long Island, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to 
coastal locations. In late August 2021, Tropical Storm Henri made landfall in Rhode Island, and despite 
the center of the storm passing well to the east of New York City and Long Island, heavy rain fell across 
the region.  
Approximately one week later in early September 2021, the remnants of Hurricane Ida brought 
catastrophic flooding to New York City. LaGuardia Airport and Central Park experienced 8.44 inches and 
7.19 inches of rainfall from this storm, much of it falling within a matter of a few hours, with peak 
rainfall rates estimated between 0.08 and 0.12 inches per minute.  
Prior to these recent events, the summer of 2020 saw two tropical cyclones that impacted New York 
State: Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Isaias. Before that, significant impacts occurred in 2012 from 
Hurricane Sandy and in 2011 from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. 
2.1.3.4. Snowstorms 
Intense lake-enhanced snowfall events occur downwind of the Great Lakes, with some storms producing 
up to 60 inches of snow. These events can last anywhere from a few hours to several days. Lake-effect 
snow is localized, and areas within miles of each other can experience large differences in snowfall 
totals. Locations downwind of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario experience these events most frequently, 
while they also occur to a lesser extent in areas in the Finger Lakes. A November 2014 event dropped 
over 5 feet of snow in some locations east of Buffalo (off Lake Erie), while in this same event, close to 2 
feet of snow fell downwind of Lake Ontario. More recently, in late November 2022, a significant, long-
duration/multi-day lake-effect event impacted locations downwind of both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. 
The highest snowfall reports were from locations just south of Buffalo, with Hamburg seeing close to 80 
inches of snow.  
In southern parts of New York State, closer to the coastal plain, snowfall amounts occasionally exceed 20 
inches during nor'easters. These events occur, on average, approximately once every 20 years. However, 
five of the top ten biggest snowstorms in New York City (as measured in Central Park) have occurred 
since 2010, with the highest total (27.5 inches) occurring on January 22–24, 2016. 
2.2. Climate Regions and Weather Stations  
The climate analyses and projections in this report are provided for individual regions across New York. 
The number of regions has expanded from seven in the prior assessment (Horton et al., 2011; 2014) to 
twelve, and the areas now align more closely with the U.S. Climate Divisions (Figure 4). These changes 
also take into consideration feedback from the Climate Needs Assessment (NYSERDA, 2020), and some 
modifications have been made to align regions more closely with existing boundaries (e.g., NYSDEC 
regions and economic development regions). The prior climate regions were constrained to county 
borders and while that generally remains the case here, 7 of the state’s 62 counties now span multiple 
regions. Of the 12 regions, 5 include counties that span more than one region. The intent is to highlight 
that some counties encompass diverse geographies and climates, and therefore may experience varied 
climate change impacts. For example, parts of Essex County in the Champlain Valley may experience a 
different climate than areas of the county deeper within the Adirondack Mountains. 
Ultimately, it is the weather stations within each region, rather than the precise boundaries and county 
delineations, that differentiate the 12 regional climates described here. Historical observations for a 
total of 27 stations across New York State were used in the historical and future analyses in this project. 
These stations were selected based on availability of long-term daily data and to be reflective of the 
8 
 
diversity of conditions across the entire state. A complete breakdown of the stations within each of the 
regions is shown in (Table 1). Because the available stations are not evenly distributed across the state, 
and due to differences in topography and proximity to water bodies, in some instances a location within 
one region might be best represented by a climate station from another nearby region.

the extreme events analysis. The * indicates that the station had sufficient data and was included in the 
extreme events work.  
3. Historical Analysis  
An analysis of historical trends in annual average temperature and precipitation was conducted for each 
of the 27 stations across New York State. The observed monthly data source used in this analysis is 
Version 2.5 of the United States Historical Climatology Network 
(ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5, Menne et al. 2009). USHCN Version 2.5 data is 
constructed using a process that favors monthly data calculated directly from the latest version of the 
daily global historical climatology network (GHCN) data. The data are quality controlled and, if possible, 
adjustments are performed where inhomogeneities are identified. 
The trends and their significance were computed for the 1901–2020 time period3. Use of a long data 
record helps distinguish the climate change signal associated with increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations from interannual and interdecadal variability. 
Trends in sea level at stations on New York’s coastline are also presented. 
 
 
3 Significance of trends in annual average temperature and precipitation were computed using the Mann-Kendall 
test.

3.1. Trends in Annual Average Temperature  
Across New York State, annual average temperatures have warmed over the past century at an average 
rate of approximately 0.20°F per decade (Figure 5)4.  Over the past 40 years, annual average 
temperature has increased at a faster rate of 0.50°F inches per decade. All 27 stations for which the 
historical analysis was completed experienced warming, and 24 had trends that were significant at the 
99% level over the 1901–2020 time period (see Table 2). This rate of warming across the northeastern 
United States over the same time period is also 0.20°F per decade. Winter warming is greatest, at a rate 
(0.33°F per decade) that is nearly double each of the other seasons.

3.2. Trends in Annual Precipitation  
The average rate of change for annual precipitation across New York State is an increase of 
approximately 0.46 inches per decade for the 1901–2020 period (Figure 6)5. Over the past 40 years, 
annual precipitation has increased at a faster rate of 1.19 inches per decade. Out of the 27 stations in 
New York State used for the trend analysis, 26 saw increases in annual precipitation (Table 3). Of those 
26 stations that have increasing precipitation, 15 had increases that are statistically significant at the 
99% level for the 1901–2020 time period. This rate of annual precipitation change is the same as the 
trend across the Northeast over the same time period, which is also about 0.46 inches per decade. 
Precipitation trends do not show significant differences among seasons. 
In addition to increased annual precipitation, year-to-year precipitation variability has become more 
pronounced. The standard deviation of annual precipitation (a measure of variability) was greater over 
the 1961–2020 period compared to 1901–1960 for 24 of the 27 stations in New York State. At the state 
level, the increased variability is significant at the 95% level.

3.3. Trends in Sea Level and Coastal Flooding  
Areas on the coastal plain—defined as Long Island, New York City, lands near the southern Hudson 
River, and small portions of southeastern Westchester County—are at risk from rising sea levels and 
enhanced coastal flooding. Sea levels in coastal New York are rising at rates faster than the global 
average. In recent years, accelerated sea level rise globally can be attributed to the expansion of oceans 
as they warm and melting of land-based ice, and some studies have suggested additional local 
acceleration due to changing ocean currents in the Atlantic (Yin, et al. 2009; Piecuch et al., 2018). The 
rate of local or relative sea level rise in New York City has averaged 0.12 inches per year from 1901 to 
2020 as measured by the tide gauge at the Battery. The Montauk Point station on eastern Long Island 
has seen sea levels rise at a rate of 0.13 inches per year for the 1947–2020 period. Both rates are nearly 
double the 1920–2022 mean global rate (Sweet et al., 2022), in part due to local land subsidence. This 
land subsidence is primarily due to local glacial isostatic adjustment, a process whereby land, once 
covered by or adjacent to glacial ice sheets, is still responding to the melting of that ice at the end of the 
last ice age. New York’s coastal region, and much of the U.S. East Coast, continues to sink as land farther 
inland that was covered by more ice rises (Engelhart et al., 2011; Engelhart and Horton, 2012). More 
recently, over the past 40 years, the rate of sea level rise at the Battery has accelerated to 
approximately 0.17 inches per year.  
Rising sea level along coastal New York State has increased the magnitude and frequency of coastal 
floods. In some locations, flooding now occurs at times of high astronomical tides, even in the absence 
of coastal storms. At the Battery, the frequency of this "nuisance flooding" (high-tide flooding) has more 
than doubled since the 1950s (Gornitz et al., 2019; Orton et al., 2019). When coastal storms do occur, 
they now flood larger areas and feature deeper—and thus more damaging and dangerous—water 
(Strauss et al., 2021).

4. Climate Projections  
Most of the quantitative results described below are based on the latest generation of global climate 
models (CMIP6) and an updated scenario framework, known as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 
(SSPs). Previous projections developed for New York State were based on CMIP5 and the RCPs or CMIP3 
and SRES. In addition to modeling and methodological advances, emerging research and expanded 
observational data availability since the last update in 2014 have also contributed to refinements of the 
projections. 
4.1. Methods 
The global climate model (GCM) simulations for the projections in this report are from the latest 
iteration of the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; 
https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) (Table 4). CMIP assesses past, present, and 
future climate changes from natural and anthropogenic sources by looking at a range of models (Eyring 
et al., 2016). The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the central CMIP6 initiative, 
providing multimodel climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land-
use changes produced by integrated assessment models (O’Neill et al., 2016).

This project follows two prior NYSERDA projects that developed climate projections for New York State. 
Presented here is a brief summary of how the key components of the projections have changed over 
time. Maintaining consistency with prior efforts, a preference of many stakeholders across the state 
based on the findings of the Climate Needs Assessment (NYSERDA, 2020), is balanced with updating the 
climate science to ensure it aligns with cutting-edge research and national and international climate 
assessments (e.g., IPCC, 2021). Table 5 below demonstrates how our methodologies have stayed the 
same, and changed, over time. In response to stakeholder feedback focused on increasing the utility and 
relevance of our projections for decision-making, key advances have included increasing the number of 
regions in the state, providing projections centered around each decade this century, and including 
compound/multivariate extremes such as humidity and heat rather than focusing on single variables like 
temperature only. Scientific advances have also led to improved and higher-resolution climate models. 
Scientific advances also encouraged us to modify projection methods to assess whether some days may, 
for example, warm more than others, a possibility not captured by the more homogenous delta method 
used in prior NYSERDA assessments.

4.1.1. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)  
For CMIP6, there is a new framework that has been used to design scenarios that combine 
socioeconomic and technological developments, known as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs; 
Raihi 2017). The SSPs are scenarios of projected socioeconomic changes across the globe through 2100 
and are used to develop the emissions scenarios. The SSPs are built upon five socioeconomic 
development narratives: sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled 
development, and middle-of-the-road development. Each SSP is consistent with multiple radiative 
forcing targets based on the timing that policies are implemented (during this century) at different 
spatial scales (Figure 8). 
The ScenarioMIP experiment developed a set of nine scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions 
trajectories (Gidden et al., 2019). These nine scenarios are broken down into two smaller groups: four 
scenarios that update the RCPs from CMIP5, achieving equivalent forcing levels of 2.5, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 
Wm−2, and five new scenarios that were not included as part of the prior RCPs. One of the new scenarios 
is a lower bound of 1.9 Wm−2 scenario, which corresponds to the most optimistic case/outcome of the 
Paris Climate Agreement.  
This report uses two SSPs: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. There have been some arguments made among 
scientists and policy makers that the greenhouse gas forcing/concentrations associated with RCP8.5 may 
be unrealistic. Here, we enumerate some of the reasons we chose to include these two RCPs and RCP 
8.5 especially. First, these scenarios have the same end-of-century radiative forcing as the two RCPs 
used in previous New York State projections, providing continuity with that work. Second, they match 
the pathways of greatest interest to stakeholders based on the Needs Assessment responses (NYSERDA, 
2020). Third, relative to many other scenarios, there were also a large number of climate models 
available for these two SSPs. Fourth, they span a broad range of what we consider plausible climate 
outcomes, including the high-consequence outcomes that are critical for risk management Wuebbles 
2023). The IPCC has never assigned likelihoods to any of the RCPs, which should instead be thought of as 
scenarios. Fifth, while most would probably argue that the balance of evidence may suggest that lower 
greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing/concentrations are more likely than those associated with RCP8.5, that 
does not mean that the changes in extreme-event statistics, or climate impacts, associated with RCP8.5 
are unrealistically high. As it becomes clearer that current climate impact models underestimate 
plausible high tails even when driven by only moderate GHG levels, it follows that using projections of 
only moderate GHG forcing would unrealistically narrow the upper bounds for the model-based 
distributions for impacts like heat waves and extreme precipitation.

4.1.2. Mean Temperature and Precipitation Methods: Model-based Distributions 
Projections for annual (as well as monthly and seasonal) average temperature and average annual (as 
well as monthly and seasonal) precipitation for all 27 stations were computed using 35 GCMs and two 
SSPs6. As a result of using the 35 GCMs and two SSPs, the combination produces a 70-member matrix of 
outputs. Keeping consistent both with the 2014 ClimAID update and stakeholder requests within New 
York State, results are presented across this range of outcomes at selected points in the distribution: the 
10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles; the 50th percentile is also available. For each time period, the 
results constitute a model-based range of outcomes, which can be used to inform risk-based decision 
making. This approach gives equal weight to each GCM and to each of the two RCPs selected. 
Mean annual temperature and precipitation projections are calculated using the delta method, used in 
both the 2011 and 2014 ClimAID reports. This method, which is a simple form of bias correction, 
compares the results for future time periods from a model to the same model’s results for the baseline

period (1981–2010). It should also be noted that geographical differences in historical climate are a 
much larger driver of projected geographical differences in future climate than are differential changes 
across regions with warming. The relatively low spatial resolution of the global climate models leads to 
shared grid boxes across some regions, and thus similar amounts of climate change. 
4.1.3. Extreme Event Methods  
For projections of extreme events, daily data from the weather stations and GCMs are used. A total of 
16 models had daily data available for both SSPs at the time of analysis. Projections were developed for 
the 19 stations deemed to have sufficient daily data available for the 1981–2010 base period (see Table 
1). 
Projections of daily temperature (maximum and minimum) and precipitation were computed using a 
method known as quantile mapping. Quantile mapping adjusts a model value by mapping percentiles of 
the model’s distribution onto percentiles of the observations (Cannon et al., 2015; Thrasher et al., 2012; 
Zhao et al., 2017). When applying a quantile-mapping-based bias correction to daily temperature 
extremes and daily precipitation, the approach uses a base period where both daily observations and 
daily GCM-simulated values are available. The quantile mapping was performed by defining the 
percentiles based on the entire 12-month calendar year. The analysis was run separately with 
percentiles defined by season, to test whether differential warming by season could skew the results if 
all 12 calendar months were drawn from together. Results were almost identical, and thus drawing from 
the full 12 months appears justified for this region. 
The quantile-mapping approach in this report uses one-percentile bins in order to strike a balance 
between 1) capturing rich information about how baseline bias and projected change can differ across 
the distribution of a variable and 2) including a sufficient number of days per bin (over 100 days across 
the 30-year period) to minimize the role of random variability associated with small sample sizes. While 
more advanced downscaling techniques could in principle sample the farthest tails of the distribution, 
the primary impediment to improved projections of the most rare events is unrelated to downscaling 
and instead reflects limits to fundamental understanding—even at the largest spatial scales—of the 
rarest extremes. This limited understanding inevitably manifests as imperfect sampling of these events 
even at large spatial scales in GCMs. Bartusek et al. (2022) describe the example of the 2021 Pacific 
Northwest heat wave, and 2023 is sadly offering sundry examples.   
For each 30-year time period, model, SSP, and station, the bias correction and downscaling approach 
was conducted as follows, using temperature in the illustrative example below. 
Each observed day between 1981 and 2010 was assigned a temperature percentile. The same procedure 
was applied separately to the GCM data in the base period and in a future period. For example, if 
October 8, 1984, was ranked in the 33rd percentile of days for temperature in the observations, the 
warming experienced in the GCM at the 33rd percentile of temperatures in the two time periods (e.g., 
4.0°F) was applied to the observed day. The resulting dataset can be thought of as a synthetic time 
series, based on the sequence of weather experienced at the station historically but modified by the 
amount of warming projected by each GCM in the temperature percentile associated with each day. 
This approach yields results that hew closely to the sequences of weather experienced over the 
observational period, but could underestimate the risk of sequences of events, such as a long-duration 
heat wave, if the observational record underestimates the true historical variability or if climate change 
modifies the sequences of hot days. We deem this approach superior for our application to an alternate 
approach—whereby the quantile bias between the GCM baseline period and observations is mapped 
onto the GCM future data—due to limitations in GCM ability to capture daily sequences of weather in 
24 
 
the region. However, to the extent that models can capture changes in sequences with climate change, 
the alternate approach would have merit.   
The synthetic time series were then used to calculate the metrics of extreme temperatures and 
precipitation. 
4.1.4. Downscaling and Regional Changes  
The projections for each of the regions of New York State are based on the GCM output from each 
model's single land-based model grid box covering the center of each region. Because each GCM has a 
different spatial resolution, the specific coordinates of each model's grid boxes differ. Most GCMs have 
resolution on the order of 100km, which does not capture local processes and topography; therefore, 
additional analysis is needed to make the GCM data useful for local climate assessment. 
Climate downscaling broadly refers to the process of using information known at large scales to make 
predictions at local scales. Downscaling helps to overcome the limitations of the coarse GCM resolution 
and can remove biases in the GCM data. There are two primary forms of downscaling. One form is 
dynamical downscaling, where output from the GCM is used to drive a regional climate model (RCM) at 
higher spatial resolution, improving the ability to simulate local processes (e.g., sea breezes) with 
greater detail. The other form is statistical downscaling, where a statistical relationship is established 
from observations between large-scale variables and a local variable. The relationship is then applied to 
the GCM data to obtain the localized changes from the GCM output. Hybrid approaches combining both 
statistical and dynamical techniques are now also being considered (Madaus et al., 2020). 
As described in the earlier section, the primary method of downscaling used in this project for changes 
in annual average temperature and precipitation is a statistical approach known as the delta method, 
and the statistical method known as quantile mapping is used for projected changes in extreme events. 
Other statistical approaches (e.g., localized constructed analogs [LOCA]) are available and offer finer-
resolution data; however, they were only beginning to be released with CMIP6 data at the time these 
projections were prepared. 
Dynamical downscaling, using RCMs, is not employed for this update, but will ultimately have useful 
applications for specific climate variables of interest for New York. For example, RCMs can be used to 
simulate fine-scale features of the climate of New York State, including extreme heat, the urban heat 
island, the sea breeze, and lake-effect snow (Notaro et al., 2015; Ortiz et al., 2019). 
4.1.5. Timeslices  
GCMs are valuable tools for projections of the likely range of change over multidecadal time periods. 
These projections, known as timeslices, are expressed relative to a baseline period of 1981–2010 for 
temperature and precipitation. This base period has been revised since the 2014 ClimAID update to be 
more consistent with U.S. climate normals, NOAA’s periodic update of its baseline observed climate.7  
Projections are provided for 30-year timeslices with the time periods centered on a given decade. Thirty-
year timeslices are used to provide an indication of the climate normals for those decades. By averaging 
over this period, much of the random year-to-year variability—or noise—is cancelled out, while the 
long-term influence of increasing greenhouse gases—or signal—remains. 
 
7 While this report was being written, NOAA updated their climate normal period to 1991–2020. The 1981–2010 
period is maintained in part due to the GCM historical runs ending in 2014.  
25 
 
Projections are provided for each decade from the 2030s through the 2080s. (The 2020s and 2090s are 
excluded, as there is insufficient model output to complete a 30-year average.)8 For certain basic 
quantitative projections (e.g., annual average temperature and annual precipitation) the projections are 
extended to 2100 using an alternate method developed for the 2014 report based on a hybrid of 
timeslices and earlier trend extrapolation. Please see Horton et al. (2014) for a more detailed 
description of this method.  
4.1.6. Sea Level Rise Methods  
Since the 2014 ClimAID update, there have been advances in sea level rise understanding and projection 
methodologies, including new approaches to capture the possibility of rapid ice melt from land-based 
ice sheets (Bamber et al., 2019; Gornitz et al., 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Several recent studies 
confirm the plausibility of high-end sea level rise scenarios (e.g., Slangen et al., 2017) and offer 
techniques to adapt projections to the regional/local scale (Carson et al., 2016; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). 
As noted earlier, coastal areas of New York State continue to experience faster rates of sea level rise 
when compared to the global average, a trend that is generally expected for the foreseeable future 
(Ezer, 2015). 
There is growing evidence that supports the plausibility of higher-end sea level rise projections, primarily 
based on observations of land-based ice loss and advances in climate modeling. Probabilistic sea level 
rise associated with high emissions scenarios, such as those presented in Kopp et al. (2017), may 
represent possible future outcomes. These projections are similar to those presented in the most recent 
National Climate Assessment (Fourth National Climate Assessment; USGCRP, 2018) and the 
accompanying technical report (Sweet et al., 2017). These two studies, along with several others, 
informed the development of an Antarctic rapid ice melt (ARIM) scenario as part of the 2019 New York 
City Panel on Climate Change Report (Gornitz et al., 2019). The ARIM scenario represents a high-impact, 
low-probability future event. The scenario incorporates the latest science on changes in land-based ice, 
including glaciers, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. 
Our report includes updated projections based on those developed for the IPCC 6th Assessment report. 
These projections are based on the CMIP6 models and SSP framework, and they incorporate advances in 
process understanding, improved and lengthened observational records, and improved ice-sheet 
modeling. Three scenarios used by the IPCC—SSP2-4.5-medium confidence, SSP5-8.5-medium 
confidence, and SSP5-8.5-low confidence—are selected for use here, since they span a broad range of 
plausible outcomes. For each scenario, the IPCC provides a full set of percentiles in 1% increments for 
tide gauges (e.g., the Battery), as well as a grid (used for Montauk Point). Because these data are 
available for years at the start of each decade (e.g., 2050), we interpolated the values to the middle year 
(e.g., 2055) of the decade to align with the 10-year timeslices previously used for sea level rise 
projections. Ten-year timeslices, rather than the 30-year timeslices used for other variables, are 
appropriate here, given the small year-to-year variability of sea level rise relative to its accelerating 
trend.  After adjusting to the midpoint of each decade, the individual one-percentile distributions of 
samples for each of the three scenarios from the IPCC are combined. This results in a distribution of 297 
values (3 scenarios x 99 quantiles)9 for each location. The percentile values are taken across this 
distribution to form the updated sea level rise projections. These projections are provided for three

locations: the Battery, Montauk Point, and Albany/Troy Dam10.  
Our results also reference the higher-end ARIM scenario projection developed in 2019 for New York 
City. We deem this to still represent a low probability, but possible, outcome that may be worth 
considering in certain decision contexts, where consequences would be particularly high. 
4.1.7. Differences between CMIP6 and CMIP5 
The CMIP6 models have a higher spatial resolution than CMIP5; grid box sizes for many models are on 
the order of approximately 70 miles by 70 miles horizontally, whereas a common resolution for CMIP5 
was approximately 140 miles by 140 miles. CMIP6 models also feature more advanced characterization 
of key system components, such as stratospheric chemistry, and more dynamic coupling across system 
components. The climate sensitivity—a measure of how sensitive global average temperatures are to 
changes in greenhouse gas concentrations—is higher in approximately one-fourth of CMIP6 models than 
in CMIP5 and earlier CMIP generations (Zelinka et al. 2019). Some studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2021) have 
argued that projections from these high-sensitivity models are less reliable than other models. The 
approach taken in this project, as in prior assessments, is that all models deserve equal weight. Reasons 
include 1) consistency with prior New York State assessment methods, 2) preference for a risk-
management-based approach that produces a large range of possible outcomes rather than a best 
estimate, and 3) concern that models may fail to sample lower-probability, high-consequence outcomes 
(see Horton et al. 2011 and section 4.1.1 here for more information about the pros and cons of model 
weighting and the discarding of purportedly unrealistic high-end outcomes).  
For the first time, the development of a comprehensive approach to sea level rise in the latest IPCC 
report offered the opportunity to rely on IPCC methods, rather than methods we had to generate 
ourselves. Therefore, there are too many differences in methodology to allow for simple explanations of 
why results differ from one assessment to the next. Below are key similarities and changes in sea level 
rise methods between this and ClimAID.  
Sea level rise projections for this report incorporate the same four components as used in the 2014 
ClimAID projections update: 1) sterodynamic sea level; 2) land-based ice loss from Antarctica, 
Greenland, and glaciers and ice caps; 3) land water storage; and 4) vertical land motion. In 2014, sea 
level rise was calculated as a sum of the individual components, derived from using different sources of 
information (e.g., set of climate models) and assumptions (e.g., for vertical land motion and ice sheet 
mass loss). With this method, the results were calculated at each of the percentiles of interest (and for 
some components, those were the only values computed or available). The distribution across the two 
emissions scenarios was only based on the model-based dynamic sea level and thermal expansion term. 
With this current update (2023), the numerical values for the full distribution for each the individual 
components are available from the IPCC. These projections are not the sum of the individual 
 
10 Projections for the Albany/Troy Dam are calculated using the data for the Battery and are adjusted for the 
appropriate rate of vertical land motion. The values for vertical land motion at the Battery are removed and then 
the local rate at the Albany/Troy Dam is added in. This is consistent with prior methods used in Horton et al. (2011 
and 2014). A recent study by Parsons et al. (2023) noted that highly developed parts of New York City’s coastline 
that are not situated on bedrock have experienced somewhat higher rates of land subsidence than used in our 
analysis and could continue to in the future. While these results are highly localized and neighborhood specific, 
rather than at the scale of our state-level analysis, they provide an example of how vulnerability can be highly 
concentrated spatially and why seemingly low-probability outcomes (such as very high sea level rise, very high 
storm surge, very severe drought, or a global financial crisis exacerbated by climate change) should never be ruled 
out entirely.

components at each distribution point but rather the total sea level change projection from the IPCC at 
that point.  
4.2. Projected Mean Annual Changes 
Presented here are the projected mean changes in annual average temperature, precipitation, and sea 
level rise. Table 6 includes results that span across all regions of New York State for average 
temperature and Table 7 for average precipitation. The 10th and 25th percentiles are the lowest of the 
12 regional values; the 50th percentile is the average across the 12 regions; and the 75th and 90th 
percentiles are the highest values across the 12 regions. The projected changes in this table are 
representative of the direction of change and approximate order of magnitude for all regions of New 
York State, with some regional differences described below.  
Tables of projected mean annual changes for each region can be found in the appendix to this report, 
including projections of monthly and seasonal changes. The ensemble average across each of the SSPs is 
also included in the appendix.  
4.2.1. Temperature  
Annual average temperatures are projected to increase across New York State by 2.5°F–4.4°F by the 
2030s, 3.8°F–6.7°F by the 2050s, and 5.1°F–10.9°F by the 2080s, relative to the 1981–2010 base 
period.11 Warming is projected to be greatest in the northern regions of the state. The projected 
changes are similar for both SSPs until approximately the 2040s, when they begin to deviate and SSP5-
8.5 has greater warming for the remainder of the century. Although observed trends have shown 
greater winter warming than other seasons, there is too much uncertainty in the climate models to draw 
this conclusion for the future. For the state as a whole, projections suggest that each season will 
experience a comparable amount of warming in the future relative to the baseline period. 
4.2.2. Precipitation  
Regional annual precipitation is projected to increase by approximately 1%–8% by the 2020s, 2%–12% 
by the 2050s, and 6%–17% by the 2080s, relative to the 1981–2010 base period.12 Projections show the 
greatest increases for areas in the southeast part of the state, although that pattern does not clearly 
emerge until late in the century. Although seasonal projections are less certain than annual results, the 
greatest increases in precipitation are projected to occur during the winter months. In the summer and 
fall seasons, smaller increases are generally projected. In summer, some models project reductions in 
precipitation.

4.2.3. Sea Level Rise  
Using the middle range (25th to 75th percentiles) across all three locations and all three scenarios, sea 
level is projected to rise along the New York State coastline and in the tidal Hudson by 7–12 inches by 
the 2030s, 12–21 inches by the 2050s, and 21–41 inches by the 2080s, relative to the 1995–2014 base 
period. The high-end estimate (90th percentile) for sea level rise by the 2080s is 48 inches. By 2100, sea 
29 
 
levels are projected to rise by as much as 69 inches (Table 8). The 10th and 25th percentiles shown in 
Table 8 are the lowest across all three locations, the 50th percentile is the average of all three locations, 
and the 75th and 90th percentiles are the highest values across the three locations. Full results for all 
three stations can be found in the appendix.  
Based on the ARIM scenario from the 2019 New York City Panel on Climate Change report, accelerated 
loss of land-based ice could lead to sea level rise of up to 81 inches by the 2080s and 114 inches by 2100 
under a plausible worst-case scenario. While unlikely, these projections are included here because they 
cannot entirely be ruled out and would have very high consequences, should they occur. Such low-
probability, high-consequence scenarios may be of interest for some risk-management decisions.

Note: Projections are shown for the low estimate (10th percentile), middle range (25th–75th percentile), 
the median (50th percentile), and high estimate (90th percentile), across all stations. Projections are 
relative to the 1995–2014 base period. These projections are based on the results from the IPCC 6th 
Assessment report. Also shown are the NPCC 2019 results for the Antarctic Rapid Ice Melt (ARIM) 
scenario. ARIM represents a physically plausible upper-end, low-probability (significantly less than 10% 
likelihood of occurring) scenario for the late 21st century, derived from recent modeling of ice sheet–
ocean behavior. The ARIM scenario contains uncertainties stemming from incomplete knowledge of ice-
sheet processes and interactions among the atmosphere, ocean, and icesheets. 
Rising sea levels, absent of changes in coastal storms, will profoundly increase the frequency and extent 
of coastal flooding. By mid-century, some coastal and estuarine locations in New York State may 
experience monthly tidal flooding ("sunny day" flood events). If New York City experiences high-end sea 
level rise, for example, monthly tidal flooding will begin to affect coastal neighborhoods such as those 
surrounding Jamaica Bay by the 2050s and many other areas by the 2080s. 
4.3. Projected Changes in Extreme Events  
This section describes quantitative projections for events where confidence in model outputs is 
relatively high and qualitative projections for those types of events where uncertainties make precise 
30 
 
quantitative projections unwise.  
4.3.1. Quantitative Changes in Extreme Events  
For quantitative extremes, presented here are the results for a single station in New York State (Table 9), 
with full results for all stations with daily data available in the appendix. The direction of change for this 
location is representative of all areas across the state, while the specific number of events will vary by 
station due to differing baseline climate values. 
 
Table 9. Projected Changes in Extreme Events for Dobbs Ferry, New York  
Note: Projections are based on 16 GCMs (14 for heat index) and 2 SSPs and are relative to the 1981–
2010 base period. Baseline data are for the 1981–2010 base period and are from the NOAA National 
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Shown are middle range (25th to 75th percentile) of 30-
year mean values from model-based outcomes. Decimal places are shown for values less than 1, 
although this does not indicate higher precision or certainty. Heat waves are defined as three or more 
consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 90°F. A degree day is defined as the 
difference between the daily average temperature and 65°F. Heating degree days occur when the daily 
average temperature is below 65°F, while cooling degree days occur when the daily average 
temperature is above 65°F. Heat index was computed using the formula from the National Weather 
Service.

4.3.1.1. Heat Waves and Cold Events  
The total number of hot days in New York State is expected to increase as this century progresses. The 
frequency and duration of heat waves, defined as three or more consecutive days with maximum 
temperatures at or above 90°F, are also expected to increase. In contrast, extreme cold events, defined 
as the number of days per year with minimum temperature at or below 32°F and days per year with 
minimum temperature at or below 0°F, are expected to decrease.   
4.3.1.2. Cooling and Heating Degree Days  
Cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD) are computed by taking the daily averaged 
temperature and finding the departures above and below 65°F, respectively. Degree days are a measure 
that estimates the amount of heating or cooling needed for a building using 65°F as a baseline. Cooling 
degree days are used to estimate energy requirements for air conditioning, whereas heating degree 
days are used to estimate energy requirements for heating. 
The results presented here are calculated by summing the daily values for the year and season to find 
the total value. Across New York State, heating degree days are projected to decrease as the century 
continues, while cooling degree days are projected to increase, reflecting the warming that is projected.  
32 
 
4.3.1.3. Heat Index  
This report includes projections that measure the combined effects of high temperature and 
atmospheric moisture. The combination of extreme heat and humidity can lead to particularly 
dangerous impacts on human health, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, those 
with certain preexisting health conditions, and those exerting themselves outdoors. Heat and humidity 
also lead to increased energy demand and reduced productivity. Projections are provided for the heat 
index, which is computed using the National Weather Service formula (Weather Prediction Center, 
2022). Because of the lack of observed station data for humidity, the analysis used data from the ERA5 
gridded reanalysis dataset for the calculation of historical heat index. The projections were calculated 
using the same methods (quantile mapping) as the other daily extreme events, using outputs from the 
GCMs for both temperature (daily) and humidity (changes in monthly climatology). Projections are 
provided for the annual maximum value of heat index and for the number of days per year with the heat 
index exceeding certain thresholds (e.g., days with heat index at or above 85°F and 95°F).  
Across all stations in New York State, heat index values are expected to increase dramatically in the 
future, due in part to the nonlinear nature of the heat index, which leads to larger and larger increases 
in the heat index as temperatures and atmospheric moisture reach higher and higher levels. 
4.3.1.4. Extreme Precipitation and Flooding  
Although the percent increase in total annual precipitation is projected to be relatively small, models 
project somewhat larger percentage increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation events (defined 
as events with more than 1, 2, or 4 inches of precipitation at daily timescales). The projections for 
changes in extreme precipitation in New York State are consistent with global projections (Ranasinghe, 
2021).  
Projecting future precipitation extremes (at daily and sub-daily scales) remains a challenge. We 
therefore apply a hybrid approach for extreme precipitation, where we supplement the model-based 
quantitative projections presented earlier with qualitative projections here. One method currently being 
investigated relies on the relationship between temperature and water-holding capacity of the 
environment. The capacity increases approximately 7% for every 1°C of warming, indicating a strong 
potential for more intense rainfall events as the climate warms. A recent study projected changes in 
precipitation extremes, where the changes are proportional to the change in atmospheric moisture 
content near the surface (Lenderink and Attema, 2015). A similar scaling approach, using the 
relationship between temperature and precipitation, was considered by Zhang et al. (2017). That study 
found that while the relationship between water-holding capacity and temperature may be suitable for 
some of the midlatitudes for some applications, large uncertainties exist. Further research shows that 
scaling rates (the relationship between warming and moisture) differ by region, temperature, and 
moisture availability (Thibeault & Seth, 2014). This research found that extreme precipitation is 
increasing with temperature in moist, energy-limited environments, which could include the Northeast.   
While the above approaches are reasonable, the possibility that the most extreme precipitation events 
could increase far more in intensity cannot be ruled out. Specifically, changes in atmospheric dynamics 
(i.e., motion in the atmosphere) could lead to stronger upward flow in convective storms, opening the 
door to the possibility of precipitation increases of 30%or more during the most extreme events. Some 
ultra-high-resolution regional climate model simulations have supported this idea (Fowler et al. 2021 
and references therein). Furthermore, should troughs in the jet stream become stronger and/or locked 
in place more often in the future, there is the possibility that the duration of rain events could increase 
along with their intensity. Research on possible changes in the jet stream is continuing, with some 
33 
 
studies (e.g., Kornhuber et al. 2020 and Kossin, 2018) finding evidence for increased stalling and slower 
movement with climate change and others suggesting that any apparent trends are due more to natural 
variability than anthropogenic warming (e.g., Screen 2021 and Barnes and Screen 2015). Observed 
trends in extreme precipitation—such as the reported roughly 50%increase in daily precipitation since 
the middle of the 20th century over the entire Northeast—support the idea that large changes in 
extreme precipitation, far in excess of 7% per degree of warming, may need to be planned for. However, 
as noted above, the possibility that natural variability explains a sizable portion of the observed trends 
cannot be entirely ruled out. It is also important to note that different storm types can respond to 
climate change in different ways. For example, a hurricane’s rainfall is driven by somewhat different 
mechanisms than a typical cool-season storm. 
Whether or not extreme precipitation increases at a faster rate than climate models suggest, extreme 
riverine flooding has the potential to increase more rapidly than extreme precipitation, especially in 
small catchments and areas with extensive impervious surfaces, such as urban environments. While all 
watersheds are unique, many could be subject to changes in the timing and magnitude of peak flows 
due to factors other than increases in precipitation, including 1) less snow and earlier snow melt, 2) 
higher evapotranspiration, 3) changes in land and water management decisions, and 4) responses of 
vegetation to climate change. The flood threat posed by ice jams may also change in certain watersheds. 
Furthermore, rivers near the coast will be affected by increases in sea level and changes in storm surge. 
In general, local hydrological modeling may be required to tease out the relative impact of the above 
factors on future water availability and flood risk.  
4.3.2. Qualitative Changes in Extreme Events  
This section presents projections of extreme events where uncertainties make any precise quantitative 
projections difficult. For these events, direction of change and order of magnitude are provided, where 
possible. Because local projections of some of these climate extremes are challenging to make, the 
projections in this section are for the highest spatial resolution available, which in some cases, for 
example, is the northeastern United States or the North Atlantic Basin.  
4.3.2.1. Extratropical Cyclones  
Projecting future changes in extratropical storms remains challenging. Projections and, to a lesser 
extent, observations support the idea of storm tracks shifting north with climate change at a 
hemispheric scale, but the implications for storms in the region are less clear (Senevirate et al. 2021). In 
contrast, it is expected that the amount of precipitation in a storm of a given intensity will increase, with 
one study (Zhang & Colle, 2017) finding East Coast extratropical cyclones could become 5%–25% wetter 
in the future relative to present-day storms. Precipitation type (i.e., rainfall vs. frozen precipitation) 
associated with nor’easters is determined by air temperatures, and models project that snowstorms are 
expected to decrease in frequency over the coming century in a warming climate. However, this 
decrease is nonlinear across storm intensity. This means that while the likelihood of a given nor’easter 
producing snow instead of rain will decrease in the future, if atmospheric conditions are cold enough to 
support frozen precipitation, storms will produce more snow (or ice) than during the present day 
(Zarzycki, 2018).  
4.3.2.2. Tropical Cyclones  
Historical trends and climate model projections generally support the idea of increased tropical cyclone 
hazards—specifically winds and coastal and inland flooding—over New York State as the century 
progresses, although the random nature of individual storm tracks will continue to dominate on the 
decadal timescale. Confidence has grown that intense tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher will 
34 
 
become more frequent in the North Atlantic, and confidence is now very high that the amount of 
precipitation will (on average) increase for storms of a given intensity (Seneviratne et al. 2021; Knutson 
et al. 2020). Both projections and historical data also show a persistent northward migration of the 
location of hurricane maximum intensity, increasing the chances that a hurricane exceeding Category 2 
status could approach coastal New York State in the future (Kossin et al., 2017). The balance of evidence 
suggests that the total number of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic will be effectively unchanged or 
perhaps decrease slightly (Kossin et al. 2017). 
One recent study (Lee et al., 2022) focused specifically on tropical cyclones in New York State projects 
that storm intensity will increase by the end of the century. This same research also projects a 
decreasing trend in storm translation speed and increasing trend in heading, which would increase the 
chances of storms approaching New York from the east at slower speeds. (Lee et al., 2022) However, 
compared to projected changes in storm intensity and precipitation rates, these changes are less 
certain. 
4.3.2.3. Thunderstorms 
A group of studies, primarily focused on the continental United States but with some regional examples, 
project an increase in the atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development 
(Seeley and Romps, 2015; Diffenbaugh et al., 2013; Trapp et al., 2007). The two primary drivers are 
convective available potential energy (CAPE) and wind shear (Brooks et al., 2003). Research shows that 
both of these factors are projected to increase in the future, although the relative contribution of each 
to changes in the overall environment for thunderstorms remains uncertain (Seeley and Romps, 2015; 
Diffenbaugh et al., 2013). Trapp et al. (2007) projected changes in the number of days favorable for 
severe thunderstorm development for a select group of cities in the United States, including New York. 
This single study projected a 100% increase the number of days for New York City.  
There are some studies that project increases in lightning in a warmer climate (Clark et al., 2017; Romps 
et al., 2014; Price and Rind, 1994). One study estimates that for each degree Celsius of warming, 
lightning may increase by approximately 12% in the United States (Romps et al., 2014). However, the 
results of more recent research, using new methods to model lightning in the future, indicate that 
decreases are also possible in the future (Finney et al., 2018). Therefore, it is unknown how lightning 
may change later in the century.  
Projections of individual thunderstorms or elements within them (e.g., hail and tornadoes) remain highly 
uncertain.  
4.3.2.4. Drought  
The projected increases in average annual precipitation suggest the possibility of decreasing drought 
risk, but this is far from certain for multiple reasons, including the fact that there are multiple sector-
specific types of drought. First, there may be large changes in the distribution of precipitation toward 
more-intense precipitation events, beyond the small changes suggested by GCMs. That is, movement 
toward larger rainfall events with fewer small events in between could imply longer dry spells that could 
encourage short-term (weeks to months) drought in some more vulnerable parts of the state, such as 
portions of the Finger Lakes region. Any tendency of the jet stream toward stronger or more prolonged 
ridges of high pressure—with their associated high temperatures, sunny skies, and lack of rainfall—
would increase the risk of rapid-onset drought, or “flash droughts.” Second, higher average 
temperatures in the warm season without increases in atmospheric humidity could lead to large 
increases in potential evapotranspiration, meaning that more precipitation is required just to maintain 
the soil moisture levels associated with the previously cooler climate. Third, reductions in snow cover 
35 
 
associated with warming would increase flood risk in the cold season but would increase drought risk in 
the warm season as soils dry out earlier, potentially inducing feedbacks through warming soil 
temperatures as they dry, fostering further drying. To summarize, while projected increases in average 
annual precipitation suggest that multiyear drought risk of most interest to large municipal water 
managers will not increase, results for shorter term, less than one-year droughts of most import to 
agriculture and water supplies for smaller communities may depend on just how much summer 
temperatures warm as well as how quickly precipitation runs off in the future. Finally, it should be kept 
in mind that the 1960’s drought and paleoclimate reconstructions (Pederson et al. 2013) demonstrated 
that, independent of climate change, a broad range of outcomes are possible in the region, even over 
multiyear timescales.  
4.3.2.5. Snowfall 
Warmer winters, a trend that has been observed in the Northeast, can mean less early-winter snowfall, 
more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, and earlier snowmelt, which can affect water 
availability throughout the spring and summer seasons (Easterling et al., 2017, citing Notaro et al., 2014, 
and Demaria et al., 2016). Recent trends reveal a gradual northward migration of the average rain–snow 
transition zone across the United States (Easterling et al., 2017). As a result, portions of New York State 
could see a 10%–50% reduction in the frequency of snowfall by the end of century, under a high 
emissions scenario (Ning and Bradley, 2015). While projected temperature increases may reduce the 
likelihood of snow, future changes in frozen precipitation are also dependent upon changes in winter 
storm intensity and track. On balance, most of New York State is likely to see a shorter snow season, 
reduced snow cover and snow depth, and fewer snow events. However, for extratropical cyclones, the 
largest snow events of all types could grow in magnitude since a warmer atmosphere can hold more 
moisture.  
In a warmer climate, increased water temperatures in the Great Lakes and Finger Lakes are projected to 
lead to delayed refreezing in fall and winter. As cold air flows over the lakes to form localized snowfall 
events, a longer season without ice could increase the amount of lake-effect snow, at least in the short 
term (Burnett et al., 2013). However, as the climate warms, the air flowing over the lakes will warm, 
thereby decreasing the vertical temperature gradient needed to form precipitation. High temperatures 
will eventually change precipitation currently falling as snow to rain in the future. It is important to note 
that global climate models have difficulty simulating lake-effect snow events due to their localized 
nature. One study found that reduced ice coverage on the lakes leads to a decrease in precipitation 
(Vavrus et al., 2013), and another study showed that by the middle of the century, while precipitation 
downwind of the lake may increase, temperatures more often may be too warm to support snowfall 
(Notaro et al., 2015). 
4.3.2.6. Extreme Cold 
Some research has raised the prospect that extreme cold-air outbreaks connected with the polar vortex, 
a large area of low pressure that is typically centered on the North Pole, may paradoxically become 
more common as high-latitude regions warm (Liu et al. 2012; Francis and Vavrus 2012). Possible changes 
in cold-air outbreaks remain a topic of active research (Screen et al., 2015; Lyons et al., 2018) linked to 
discussions about the loss of Arctic sea ice, increases in atmospheric blocking events, and changes in the 
jet stream (Screen and Simmonds, 2010; Liu et al. 2012; Overland et al., 2015). Increased high-latitude 
blocking and a more "wavy" jet stream can allow for cold air to flow down from the Arctic deep into the 
midlatitudes. Some research has shown that there is a relationship between the melting of sea ice and 
cold-weather outbreaks (Overland et al., 2015; Screen et al., 2018,) and studies have found that climate 
models can simulate similar results (Zhang et al., 2018). These changes are consistent with recent 
36 
 
observations that polar-vortex events are on the rise (Kretschmer et al., 2018). However, additional 
research suggests that such consistent changes in the jet stream are unlikely (e.g., Barnes and Screen, 
2015). The most recent IPCC report found low confidence in the relative contribution of Arctic warming 
to midlatitude atmospheric changes (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021). There is also no evidence that cold-air 
outbreaks in the United States have increased because of this (the polar vortex) or other phenomena 
(Screen et al., 2015). Furthermore, as climate change steadily increases average winter temperatures, it 
will become more and more difficult for even anomalously strong jet stream perturbations to yield 
record-breaking winter weather.   
4.3.2.7. Great Lakes Water Levels and Ice Cover 
Great Lakes water levels, including Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, fluctuate frequently and experience high 
variability at annual and sub-annual time scales. The period 1998–2013 had below-normal water levels 
(Assel et al., 2003), while recent years (2014–2020) have seen above-normal levels. Record-high water 
levels were set in the spring of 2017 for Lake Ontario and in 2018 and again in 2019 for Lake Erie.  
Factors that contribute to lake levels include precipitation, runoff, and evaporation; precipitation over 
the lakes and runoff from the shore add to the water supply of the basin and increase water levels, 
while evaporation does the opposite. These processes compete with each other to influence lake levels 
in the absence of other non-climatic factors.  
The most recent studies project increasing water levels in the Great Lakes, including Lake Erie and Lake 
Ontario (VanDeWeghe et al. 2022; Kayastha et al. 2022). This differs from prior modeling studies that 
projected slight declines by the middle to end of century in water levels, including Lake Erie and Lake 
Ontario (Notaro et al., 2015; Lofgren and Rouhana, 2016). These studies did indicate that slightly higher 
water levels are still possible in the future. Over time, research has shown that projected declines in 
water levels are not likely to be as great as once thought. It is also important to note that in the future, 
large variability at seasonal, annual, and multiyear timescales is expected to continue. These projections 
are thus characterized by large uncertainty, and fluctuating periods of high and low water levels are still 
expected in the future. 
Recent trends in Great Lake ice cover show a decline in the number of days with ice cover over the past 
half century. For Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, the decrease in ice coverage for the 1973–2010 period was 
50% and 88%, respectively (Wang et al., 2012). The shift to less ice cover has tended to occur abruptly, 
rather than through gradual decline (Mason et al., 2016). Lake ice coverage also experiences high 
variability, and year-to-year fluctuations can be high depending on environmental conditions, such as 
temperature and evaporation. Winter 2022–2023 saw far below normal ice coverage on both Lake Erie 
and Lake Ontario. 
Looking into the future, continued declines in lake ice coverage are projected as temperatures warm. 
However, there will likely be periods of high ice coverage that deviate from the long-term downward 
trend. These periods are expected to coincide with winters with strong cold-air outbreaks. The recent 
winters of 2014 and 2019 are examples of years with very ice high cover and cold conditions. While the 
multiple factors that influence lake ice cover, including larger patterns of atmospheric circulation, 
introduce some uncertainties, on balance, ice cover is projected to continue to decrease in the future as 
water and air temperatures warm. 
4.3.2.8. Compound Extreme Events  
Compound weather or climate events are combinations of multiple climate drivers or hazards that have 
a larger or different impact than an individual driver or hazard would have on its own. Recent research 
37 
 
in this area has concentrated on both understanding the different classes or categories of compound 
events and investigating these specific extremes. Some studies have focused on the nonlinear impacts of 
compound extremes and the failure of entities to properly conceptualize and understand these complex 
impacts or develop resilience strategies tailored to them (Raymond et al. 2020). Some authors have 
considered cases in which compounding goes beyond climate hazards to include other aspects of human 
and natural systems (Raymond et al. 2020), such as the risk of power failures and poor air quality, both 
of which are correlated with extreme heat and can have serious effects on human health. Another study 
has categorized compound extremes into four primary categories, each of which is applicable in New 
York State: 1) preconditioned, 2) multivariate, 3) temporally compounding, and 4) spatially 
compounding (Zscheischler et al., 2020). 
Preconditioned events describe when one or more hazards can cause an impact, or lead to an amplified 
impact, only because of a preexisting, climate-driven condition. Examples include heavy rainfall on top 
of snow, and false spring (when typical cold conditions return after unseasonable warmth). Rain-on-
snow events are not uncommon in the Northeast (Cohen et al., 2015). Recent examples of false spring 
events have damaged agricultural crops and forest products in the Northeast, including maple syrup 
(Hufkens et al., 2012) and fruit crops (Wolfe et al., 2018). 
Multivariate events refer to the co-occurrence of multiple climate drivers or hazards in the same 
geographical region. Examples include the combined effects of heat and humidity, or heavy rain, strong 
winds, and storm surge that result in flooding events during coastal storms. As an example, a paper by 
Coffel et al. (2017) found that under RCP 8.5, dangerous humidity and heat events in the northeastern 
U.S. could become approximately 30 times more common than they are today within two generations.  
Temporally compounding events refer to a succession of hazards that affect a given geographical region, 
amplifying an impact or leading to additional impacts when compared with a single hazard. One 
example is a heat wave following a strong thunderstorm event that knocks out power, and therefore air 
conditioning. In recent years, events like this have occurred in the Mid-Atlantic, in particular in the 
Washington D.C., metropolitan area. This particular combination of strong storms and power outages 
followed by extreme heat may be of increasing concern in the future with climate change (Matthews et 
al., 2019). Another example is sequences of extreme winter weather, such as back-to-back nor’easters, 
often intertwined with extended cold-air outbreaks. Consecutive nor’easters impacted southern parts of 
New York State in March 2018. The consecutive nature of these storms caused prolonged periods of 
high tides and coastal flooding on Long Island and New York City. Locations in upstate New York 
experienced heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions from this same event. Such sequences can be 
associated with persistent troughs in the jet stream to the west and in New York State, sometimes 
linked physically and in popular media with the polar vortex described above. 
Spatially compounding events occur when multiple connected locations are affected by the same or 
different hazards within a limited time window, thereby causing an impact. For example, atmospheric 
blocking could cause an unusually large portion of northeastern watersheds to experience heavy 
precipitation over the same time period, leading to nonlinear increases in riverine flood risk in New York 
State and beyond. In some instances, the climate extremes occurring in New York State will occur over a 
larger area, potentially leading indirectly to increased impacts in New York State. For example, energy 
demand for cooling during the more geographically expansive heat waves associated with climate 
change (Lyon et al., 2019) could lead to less available supply for New York State. As another example, 
certain configurations of the jet stream are associated with increased risk of simultaneous breadbasket 
crop failures, especially due to heat and drought, with implications for global food prices and food 
security (Kornhuber et al. 2020).

5. Conclusion and Research Needs  
Across New York State, trends toward higher temperatures and more precipitation have become more 
robust in the decade since the first New York State climate assessment. As the availability and 
complexity of climate model simulations have expanded, projections for temperature and precipitation 
have remained relatively similar to a decade ago. It remains clear that even small increases in average 
temperatures will be associated with large changes in the statistics—that is, the frequency, intensity, 
and duration—of many types of extreme events. Across a range of variables, the upper tail of 
projections has grown higher in the past decade even as the lower bound has tended to remain similar.  
Like all projections, these climate projections include irreducible uncertainties (Hawkins and Sutton, 
2009). Sources of uncertainty include future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcing 
agents, data limitations, the random nature of some parts of the climate system, and physical system 
response, including but not limited to climate sensitivity as radiative forcing changes. Uncertainties 
associated with future greenhouse gas concentrations and physical system response dominate as the 
century progresses. Uncertainty is assessed using state-of-the-art climate models, multiple scenarios of 
future greenhouse gas concentrations, and recent peer-reviewed literature. Even so, the projections are 
not true probabilities, so the general range of results rather than the specific numbers should be 
emphasized, and the potential for outcomes outside the range presented here cannot be ruled out. 
Moving forward, there is a need for further research in several areas. First and most fundamentally, 
more and improved observational data and modeling are essential. Additional weather stations, plus 
additional data sources on information like soil moisture are high priority. Higher resolution global 
models, as well as regional models at convection-permitting spatial scales, will also yield new insights 
over time.  Second, a better understanding of how extreme events may change across the state is 
needed. While there is no single agreed upon method to achieve this, a combination of observational 
and modeling studies is needed focused on 1) large-scale drivers of extreme events, such as remote 
ocean temperature anomalies that can influence the jet stream; and 2) fine-scale processes, such as 
urban heat islands and convective precipitation. Third, the last decade has revealed the importance of 
compound extreme events, something that most assessments to date have not considered rigorously, 
and that has not been extensively evaluated yet for GCMs. Finally, further work is also needed on 
identifying climate metrics of particular use to decision-makers and those with climate impact expertise, 
building on but going beyond the work conducted for the 2020 NYSERDA needs assessment. Continuing 
to support applied climate research will ensure that climate science will continue to inform cutting-edge 
solutions in adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation for New York State.
