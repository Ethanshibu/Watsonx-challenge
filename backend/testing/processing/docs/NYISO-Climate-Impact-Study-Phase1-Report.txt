Overview 
Over the last ten years, there has been a growing concern about the impact of climate change 
on the environment and ultimately impact on humanity.  It has been well documented that the 
air mass and oceans are warming, contributing to degradation of our environment, more 
extreme weather events, and potentially catastrophic events in the future.  New York State 
and New York City have been working to address the growing likelihood of Sandy-like 
storms in the future as a result of warming temperatures and rising sea level.  NYISO is 
concerned about how climate change may impact the state transmission system, as NYISO is 
responsible for managing the New York wholesale power market, maintaining system 
reliability, and planning for future capacity needs. 
 
To this end, NYISO contracted with Itron, Inc. to develop long-term energy, peak, and 
hourly load projections that captures the impact of increasing temperatures and state policy 
designed to improve energy efficiency and address climate change.  Long-term hourly zonal-
level load forecasts will be used in the second phase of the study to evaluate system impact 
and develop a climate resiliency plan.  
 
The primary study objectives include: 
 
• Developing a long-term energy, peak, and 8,760 hourly load forecasts that reflect the 
potential demand impact of climate change on the system and planning zones 
 
• Evaluating statewide temperature and humidity trends in context of recent state and 
other climate impact studies 
 
• Translating temperature and humidity projections into long-term Heating Degree 
Days (HDD), Cooling Degree Days (CDD), and peak-day Temperature Humidity 
Index Degree Days (TDD) to drive system and planning area load models.  
 
• Constructing long-term forecast scenarios that reflect state policy goals to address 
climate change impacts 
o Policy Case: Accelerated energy efficiency savings and Behind-the-meter 
(BTM) solar adoption 
o Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) Case: State 
electrification to meet targeted greenhouse gas emission targets

1. Summary 
The core finding is that temperatures are rising across New York and will have a significant 
impact on summer peak demand.  Since early 1990 temperatures across the state have been 
increasing from 0.06 to 0.09 degrees per year or 0.6 to 0.9 degrees per decade. On average, 
the statewide average temperature is increasing 0.7 degrees per decade.  The temperature 
trends are consistent with the NYSERDA comprehensive climate impact study (September 
2014 ClimAID Update), New York City’s recent climate resiliency plan (March 2019 
Climate Resiliency Design Guideline) and observed temperature trends across the country.  
Temperature trend analysis is presented in Section 2. 
 
On an annual basis, increasing temperatures have minimal impact on system energy 
requirements as increasing cooling sales are largely mitigated by decreasing heating related 
sales.  However, the system load profile will change over time with the strongest load growth 
in the shoulder months (April, May, September, and October).  Summer and winter peak 
demand will also be significantly impacted by climate change.  By 2050, increasing 
temperatures will potentially add between 1,600 MW to 3,800 MW or 10% to 23% of 
summer-peak cooling requirements. Additional discussion of the impact of increasing 
temperatures on system peak load is included in Section 3. 
 
State policy designed to counter the impact of climate change may have an even larger 
impact on load than increasing temperatures.  New state energy efficiency targets largely 
mitigate the impact of increasing temperatures on summer peak demand through 2045; after 
that point increasing electric vehicle demand and electrification activity eventually push 
loads above current trend. 
 
In the most aggressive scenario, statewide electrification programs result in the system 
switching from a summer peaking system to a winter peaking system; this occurs around 
2035.  While there is still additional analysis to be done to translate greenhouse gas targets to 
specific end-use impacts, the amount of electrification needed to achieve state greenhouse 
gas targets has significant impacts on base loads, heating loads and cooling loads. An 
aggressive electrification program could add more than 28,000 MW to the system summer 
peak by 2050, and an even larger amount to winter peaks. 
 
An end-use modeling framework is used to assess these policy impacts.  The modeling 
framework allows us to estimate the impact of changes in end-use saturation and efficiency 
trends on customer class sales, system energy, hourly loads, and ultimately system peaks.  An 
overview of the modeling framework is presented in Section 4. 
 
Forecasts for the period from 2020 through 2050 are provided for the system and eleven 
planning zones are provided in Appendix A.  Forecasts includes annual energy, summer 
coincident peak, and winter coincident peak forecasts for four scenarios. Appendix B 
provides a detailed description of the residential and commercial Statistically Adjusted End-
Use (SAE) models used in developing class sales and end-use energy forecasts.  Weather

C, along with statewide maps.

2. Climate Impact Studies 
New York has been on the forefront of studying temperature trends and the potential impact 
from climate change.  In 2011, NYSERDA released the first major climate impact study for 
New York (Responding to Climate Change in New York State: The ClimAID Integrated 
assessment for effective climate change adaption in New York State. Final report). 
This study was updated in September 2014 by climatologists from Columbia University, 
Cornell University and the City University of New York.  (Horton, R., D. Bader, C. 
Rosenzweig, A. DeGaetano and W.Solecki. 2014. Climate Change in New York State: 
Updating the 2011 ClimAID Climate Risk Information. New York State Energy Research and 
Development Authority (NYSERDA), Albany, New York). 
 
Based on the most advanced climate models at that time, the ClimAID team found that 
temperature warming trends are slightly worse than the initial study.  The study concluded 
that New York could expect to see hotter summers, warming winters, increasing rainfall, 
rising oceans, and more extreme weather events. 
 
The potential impacts of climate change were glimpsed when New York was hit by 
Hurricane Sandy on October 29th, 2012.  Superstorm Sandy caused an estimated $19 billion 
in losses in New York City and over $32 billion in losses in the state.  There were 48 
reported storm-related deaths, subways and tunnels were flooded, thousands of homes were 
destroyed, and with the impact on the transportation and communication systems, the City 
was effectively shut down for several days.  Hundreds of thousands of City residences were 
without power for several days. 
 
Recognizing there may be an increasing likelihood of future storms of this magnitude, both 
New York City and Consolidated Edison (ConEdison) have been working to improve climate 
resiliency.  In March 2019, the City released the Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines.  The 
report outlines the most recent plan for building a more climate-resilient city.  The New York 
Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) provides the weather projections that formed the basis of 
the city resiliency plan and also worked on the 2014 ClimAID update.  Current planning is 
based on the second Panel on Climate Change Report (NPCC2) long-term weather 
projections, which found the 2014 ClimAID projections to still be on track. 
 
ConEdison launched a project in 2017 specifically focused on evaluating how climate change 
will potentially impact the electric, gas, and steam distribution operation and network and 
identifying infrastructure needs to build a more resilient distribution system. This project is 
expected to be completed by the end of 2019 (ConEdison Climate Change Vulnerability 
Study, ongoing).  As part of this study, long-term climate change projections were updated by 
the Columbia Center for Climate System Research (CCSR) for the ConEdison service area.  
Results of this study should be available early next year. 
 
In climate models, temperature and humidity projections are driven by projected levels of 
greenhouse gas concentration.  There are a number of complex General Circulation Models 
(GCM) that model how increases in greenhouse gases interact with other factors that impact 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 6 
  
 
temperature trends.  These factors include current weather conditions, the amount of the 
sun’s energy absorbed and radiated to space, forests, agricultural lands, and other vegetation 
that absorb and ultimately release CO2 gases, and physical changes in the earth such as 
melting ice caps and rising oceans that feedback through the model over time. 
 
In 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) established a set of four 
possible greenhouse gas concentration paths that provide a common set of inputs for 
modeling weather impacts.  These paths, known as Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCPs) relate to the level of the sun’s energy absorbed by the Earth and radiated back to 
space (radiative or climate forcing).  With a higher RCP, there is an increase in temperature 
as the amount of energy trapped in the atmosphere increases.  The RCPs are physical paths 
but can roughly be associated with specific human activity and response (or lack of response) 
to climate change.  Defining socioeconomic conditions associated with these paths have been 
designated Shared Socioeconomic reference Pathways (SSPs).  Figure 1 shows four of these 
relative concentration paths. 
 
Figure 1:  Relative Greenhouse Concentration Paths 
 
 
RCP 8.5 represents the worse possible path.  Greenhouse gases continue escalating at a faster 
rate and do not begin to level off until after 2100.  RCP 2.6 represents the best possible path. 
Implicit in the RCP 2.6 path is immediate global action to address climate change.  RCP 4.5 
is consistent with current man-made emission trends; greenhouse gases continue to increase 
at roughly current rates with increases slowing significantly by mid-century and eventually 
leveling out at a little over 550 ppm.  While RCP 8.5 begins to increase at a faster rate after 
2020, there is no significant divergence between any of the paths until 2030.

2.1 Temperature Projections 
While climate change will have an impact on many weather-related factors including rainfall, 
sea level, cloud coverage, and more extreme weather events; this study focuses on 
temperature and humidity projections as these have the most significant impact on electricity 
demand. 
 
The 2014 ClimAID update compared modeled temperatures for future decades against a 
base-year temperature.  The base-year temperature is defined as the average temperature 
between 1971 and 2000; if temperatures have been warming over this period then the 
reference year is 1990 (the midpoint of the 30-year temperature range).  Table 1 shows 
ClimAID projected temperatures for New York City.  The table is from the September 2014 
updated report. 
 
Table 1: New York City – Temperature Forecast Increase From Base Year 
 
 
Using 1990 as the base year implies temperatures in New York City are expected to increase 
0.5 degrees per decade (Low Estimate) to 1.1 degree per decade (High Estimate).  Averaging 
the middle range results in 0.8 degrees per decade.  New York City NPCC has confirmed the 
reasonableness of projected New York City temperature trend as the basis for developing the 
City’s current climate resiliency plan.   
 
Other studies show similar projections.  The California Fourth Climate Change Assessment 
projects average temperatures that are 5.6 to 8.8 degrees higher by 2100; this is an increase of 
0.7 to 1.1 degrees per decade (August, 2018 http://www.climateassessment.ca.gov).  The 
IPCC in their most recent temperature projections show that by 2100, global average 
temperatures increase 1.1 to 2.6 Celsius for RCP 4.5 and 2.6 to 4.8 Celsius for RCP 8.5 over 
the base-year period (1986 – 2005); this translates into roughly 0.5 to 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit 
per decade. (https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL.pdf). 
 
A recent study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Board and University of Pennsylvania 
(https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/pier/working-paper/2019/evolution-us-temperature-
dynamics)  evaluated annual average temperature trends for fifteen weather stations across 
the United States.  Figure 2 shows the study results.

Temperature trends varied from 0.36 degrees per decade in Boston to as high as 1.06 degrees 
per decade in Las Vegas.  Historical trends are consistent with climate model projections. 
 
One thing to note when reviewing climate study results is that the RCPs are physical 
greenhouse gas paths; there is no assigned probability.  The RCPs were adopted in 2015 to 
provide a consistent set of input to all global climate models.  The RCPs replace a set of 
socioeconomic scenarios.  There is no significant divergence in the RCP paths until 2030, at 
which point the RCP 8.5 path accelerates.  RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 track each other through 
2060.  RCP 2.6 is the best case scenario, with greenhouse gases beginning to decline around 
2040.  Most studies focus on the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 outcomes. ClimAID and NPCC use 
RCP 4.5 to represent the low bound (assigned the 10th percentile) and RCP 8.5 to represent 
the worst case (assigned the 90th percentile); mid-range estimates are generated by the 
distribution of different GCM results.  The California study calls RCP 8.5 the “Business as 
Usual” path. 
 
The ClimAID study implies long-term average temperature increases between 0.5 to 1.1 
degrees per decade with mean projection of 0.8 degrees per decade.  Projected trends are 
consistent with the California climate assessment study, IPCC’s global temperature 
projections, and recent temperature trends found across the country.

3. Weather Analysis 
3.1 Estimate Temperature Trends 
At the beginning of this project, we (i.e., Itron in coordination with NYISO staff) elected to 
develop a forecast based on historical weather trends rather than output from global climate 
models.  The analysis entailed estimating temperature and Temperature Humidity Index 
(THI) trends from historical weather data at the weather station level, evaluating the 
reasonableness of these trends for forecasting, defining a temperature band that is consistent 
with state climate impact studies, and translating trended temperatures and Cumulative 
Temperature Humidity Index (CTHI) into heating, cooling, and peak degree-days for sales, 
energy, load profiles, and peak models. 
 
The core of the analysis is the evaluation of long-term weather trends across New York State.  
Historical observations include daily data starting January 1, 1950 and extending through 
December 31, 2018 for 21 weather stations.  Weather concepts evaluated include maximum 
and minimum temperatures, hot and cold days, THI (a temperature/humidity weighted 
variable), and cumulative THI (a three-day weighted THI variable).  Table 2  lists the 21 
weather stations. (See Appendix C for a map showing the locations of these stations.)

While we explored a wide range of temperature and humidity concepts, we ultimately settled 
on a few temperature concepts where there are measurable trends, which could be translated 
into model weather variables such as heating and cooling degree-days, and could be 
compared with other studies.  Final temperature concepts include: 
 
• Average temperature (AvgDB): Average daily temperature 
• Cold-day average temperature (MinAvgDB): Average temperature on the coldest day  
• Hot-Day average temperature (MaxAvgDB): Average temperature on the hottest day 
• Hot- Day cumulative THI (MaxCTHI): Average CTHI on the hottest day 
 
Annual trend models were estimated for each of the temperature concepts.  The historical 
period is from 1950 to 2018; this provides 69 annual observations for each concept and 
weather station.  An example of the dataset is shown in Figure 3 for the Albany weather 
station (ALB).

Figure 4: Annual CTHI Values at Albany – Degrees F 
 
 
The modeling analysis involved fitting statistical trend models to the historical temperature 
and CTHI data series.  We explored several model functions and determined that a hinge-fit 
model best explained historical weather trends and resulted in reasonable temperature trend 
estimates, which are consistent with other trend analyses, the ClimAID study update, and our 
own analysis of other regions. 
 
A hinge-fit model is a relatively simple specification that involves finding the point in time 
where there is a statistically measurable change in temperature trend.  The model 
specification is: 
 
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐= 𝑓𝑓(𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑦𝑦, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶) 
 
Where: 
c = Weather concept: 
AvgDB 
MinAvgDB 
MaxAvgDB 
MaxCTHI 
 
y = year 
HingedTrend = A variable whose value is 0 from 1950 to 1991, then increases by 1 
each year thereafter 
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1

Figure 5 depicts the actual and predicted results. 
 
Figure 5: Hinge-Fit Model 
 
 
Figure 6 shows the average temperature trend projection for the Albany airport weather 
station. 
 
Figure 6: Albany Average Temperature Trend – Degrees F 
 
 
The upper and lower light blue lines show the 90% confidence interval around the 
temperature trend.  The year 1992 was selected as the common hinge-point as this provided 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 13 
  
 
the best overall fit across all the weather stations and weather concepts.  Using a common 
hinge point allows us to isolate trends across weather stations and concepts that are not 
determined simply by differences in the starting point of the data series.  The average 
temperature trend is highly statistically significant; this is true across all the weather stations.  
The estimated coefficient on Albany average temperature is 0.11; this implies that since 1992 
temperatures on average have been increasing 0.11 degrees per year or 1.1 degrees per 
decade (climate analysis generally discuss temperature trends in terms of decades). 
 
One of the interesting discoveries is that the temperatures on the hottest days and coldest 
days are trending at different rates.  Figure 7 and Figure 8 show temperature trends on the 
hottest and coldest days. 
 
Figure 7: Albany Hot-Day Weather Trend – Degrees F 
 
Figure 8: Albany Cold-Day Trend – Degrees F 
 
 
The average temperatures on the coldest days are increasing faster than average temperatures 
on the hottest days.  This is true for all the weather stations except La Guardia and Islip 
where this relationship is reversed. 
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 14 
  
 
While days are getting warmer, the maximum hourly temperatures are not.  Increases in 
temperatures have largely been driven by increasing minimum temperatures.  Figure 9 shows 
the maximum hourly temperature and Figure 10 shows the minimum hourly temperature. 
 
Figure 9: Albany Maximum Hourly Temperature – Degrees F 
 
 
Figure 10: Albany Minimum Hourly Temperature – Degrees F 
 
 
Another finding is that there are significant differences in temperature trends across the state.  
Figure 11 and  Figure 12 show the temperature trend for Central Park and La Guardia. Both 
stations are within New York City, but have significantly different temperature trends. 
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 15 
  
 
Figure 11: Central Park Average Temperature Trend Degrees F 
 
 
Figure 12: La Guardia Average Temperature Trend – Degrees F 
 
 
Average temperatures at Central Park are increasing 0.6 degrees per decade while average 
temperatures at La Guardia are increasing 1.0 degrees per decade.  Similarly, temperatures on 
the hottest days are increasing 0.4 degrees per decade at Central Park compared with 1.4 
degrees per decade at La Guardia.   
 
Estimated trend coefficients are used in constructing the long-term model weather variables. 
The are 84 resulting coefficients - 21 weather stations, each with 4 weather concepts.  
Transmission District temperature trend coefficients were calculated using a weighted 
average of weather station coefficients.  The weather station weights were derived by the 
NYISO forecasting team based on weather station to Transmission District mapping.  A 
similar set of weights were derived for each NYISO Load Zone and for the NYCA system as 
a whole.  Table 3 shows the resulting weather trend coefficients for each Transmission 
District and the system (NYCA).  (Appendix C includes the weather station weights.) 
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 16 
  
 
Table 3: Transmission District and System Weather Trend Coefficients  
(Degrees F per Decade) 
 
 
The state average temperature trend is 0.71 degrees per decade with peak-day CTHI 
averaging 0.63 degrees per decade.  Average temperatures by Transmission District vary 
from 0.59 to 0.90 degrees per decade.   
 
For all but LIPA, average temperatures on the coldest days are increasing faster than average 
temperatures on the hottest days. In LIPA is dominated by ISLIP airport were temperatures 
on the hottest days are increasing faster than the average temperatures.  We believe proximity 
to the ocean plays a part in this trend.  Table 4 shows expected average temperatures based 
on current temperature trends.  
 
Table 4: Expected Temperature Average Temperature – Degrees F 
 
 
 
Differences in hot-day and cold-day temperature trends complicate the impact temperatures 
have on load over time.  Thinking about it in terms of a temperature duration curve, the 
temperature curve is not only shifting out over time as average temperature increases, but the 
shape itself is changing — it is getting fatter at the bottom and steeper at the top.  In Figure 
13, the blue line represents the unadjusted temperature duration curve, which remains 
constant from year-to-year, while the red line represents the adjusted temperature duration 
curve, which is adjusted to hit the average, maximum, and minimum targets.  As illustrated, 
the deviations from the unadjusted curve increase as the forecast horizon progresses.

When translated into monthly CDD, the shoulder-month CDDs (in April, May, September, 
and October) increase faster than in the summer months (June, July, and August). 
Effectively, summer is coming earlier and persisting longer.  Over time, system and zonal 
loads flatten out as loads in the shoulder months increase faster than loads in the summer 
months. 
 
3.2 Calculate Trended Normal Temperatures 
Forecasted HDD, CDD, and TDD are derived by combining historical average temperatures 
with the trend calculations.  Daily, peak-day, and monthly degree-days are calculated for 
each planning area and the system. 
 
The first step is to calculate “normal” daily average temperatures and CTHI.  Daily normal 
temperatures are calculated using an “average-by-date” approach over the period January 1, 
1999 to December 31, 2018; 2018 is the last full year of data.  That is, take the following 
steps: 
 
• Average all the January 1st values 
• Average all the January 2nd values 
• … continue through end of year… 
• Average all the December 31st values 
 
The daily average is then assigned to a typical weather pattern that assures that the peak-
producing weather conditions occur on a weekday.  This is important for the purposes of 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 18 
  
 
generating the peak demand forecast, as it complicates the analysis to have the most extreme 
days occurring on a weekend.  While it is true that extreme weather can and will occur on 
weekends, it is necessary from a forecasting perspective to ensure the forecasts are producing 
extreme load values, which generally occur on weekdays, rather than to obscure the analysis 
with the offsetting effects of the weekend.  Figure 14 shows the resulting normal daily 
temperature series for the state. 
 
Figure 14: State-level daily normal average temperatures – Degrees F 
 
 
One thing to note is that averaging-by-date first and then calculating degree-days will result 
in a small bias adjustment downward in the number of CDD in the shoulder months.  
Typically, we would calculate degree-days first and then average the daily degree-days 
series.  But as the trends are calculated on temperature (so they are consistent with climate 
studies), we elected to accept the slightly biased shoulder-month CDD. 
 
The next step is to calculate a normal temperature duration curve.  The daily normal 
temperature (365 values for non-Leap Years and 366 value for Leap Years) are ranked from 
the highest temperature to the lowest temperature, as illustrated in Figure 15. 
 
Figure 15: Normal Temperature Duration Curve 
 
 
Normal daily average temperatures are shown in green.  The associated maximum daily 
temperature is red and associated minimum temperature is blue. 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 19 
  
 
 
The starting duration curve represents the average temperature over the period from 1999 to 
2018.  Effectively, it represents the 2009 expected temperatures (i.e., the midpoint of the 
1999–2018 period).  To get to the forecast starting point (2019), the normal-weather 
temperature curve for the system is shifted up 0.07 degrees per year (0.7 degrees per decade). 
 
In summary, the steps to reach the starting year normal temperatures include: 
 
• Sorting temperatures from high to low 
• Averaging by season (1999 – 2018) 
• Adjusting the starting temperature duration curve to the 2019 start-year.  This value is 
already 20 years from the starting point (i.e., 1999). This starting point (2019) is the 
basis for trending temperatures through 2050. 
 
At the state level, the temperature curve continues to shift upward over time at 0.7 degrees 
per decade, but trend analysis has shown that the temperatures on the coldest days (1.0 
degrees per decade) are increasing faster than the average temperature, while temperatures on 
the hottest days (0.6 degrees per decade) are increasing slower than the average temperature.  
The temperature curve is adjusted over time to reflect these differences in temperature trends 
by performing the following steps: 
 
• Adjusting the curve upward to match the hottest day (increasing .06 degrees per year) 
• Pivoting the curve to match the coldest day (increasing 0.1 degrees per year) 
• Calibrating to the annual average temperature (increasing 0.07 degrees per year) 
 
The adjustment process is illustrated in Figure 16. 
 
Figure 16: Depiction of Trended Normal Adjustment Process 
 
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 20 
  
 
 
Finally, we map the duration curves to the typical weather pattern with two versions: 
 
• Rotation by Day always puts the hottest day on a specified weekday (e.g., 
Wednesday).  This approach is useful for the hourly load modeling and it ensures that 
the extreme weather days do not rotate onto a weekend, which will impact the peak 
demand values. 
• Rotation by Calendar always starts the pattern on January 1st.  This approach is 
useful for the monthly energy forecasting and it ensures that the calendar-month 
degree days do not vary (with the movement of the calendar) from year to year.  In 
other words, this ensures that the July CDD values do not change from year to year, 
which will impact the monthly energy forecast. 
 
The resulting daily normal temperature data series for NY state in 2020 and 2040 are 
illustrated in Figure 17.  The most salient feature of the figure is that the 2040 values are 
higher than the 2020 values, not every single day, but in aggregate. 
 
Figure 17: New York State Normal Daily Temperatures: 2020 and 2040 
 
 
3.3 Calculate CDD, HDD, and Peak-day TDD  
Daily, monthly, and peak-day degree-days are used in driving energy and demand.  Degree-
days are calculated from actual and trended-normal average temperatures.  Typically, CDD 
and HDD are calculated with a 65-degree base temperature.  As the relationship between 
energy use and temperature is nonlinear, forecast models of energy use can be improved by 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 21 
  
 
using CDD and HDD variables with different and potentially multiple temperature 
breakpoints. 
 
The formulas for CDD and HDD are as follows: 
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑑𝑑
𝑏𝑏= 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑−𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏, 0) 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑑𝑑
𝑏𝑏= 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏−𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑, 0) 
 
Where: 
d  
 
= date 
b  
 
= critical turning point (e.g., 65, 70, 75) 
AvgDB  
= average Daily Temperature 
 
CDD values return a positive value when the temperature is above the Breakpoint and HDD 
values return a positive value when the temperature is below the Breakpoint.  Otherwise, 
each variable returns 0.  The daily CDD and HDD values are used as drivers in the hourly 
load models. 
 
For the purposes of monthly energy forecasting, the CDD and HDD values are summed over 
the days in the month as follows: 
 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑦𝑦,
𝑏𝑏= ෍𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦
𝑏𝑏
𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦
 
 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑦𝑦,
𝑏𝑏= ෍𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦
𝑏𝑏
𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦
 
Where: 
y = year (e.g., 2010, 2011) 
m = month (e.g., 1, 2, …12) 
d = day (e.g.., 1, 2, … 31) 
b = breakpoint (e.g., 65, 70, 75) 
 
For the purposes of the monthly peak demand forecast model, Itron utilized a TDD (i.e., THI 
Degree Day) calculated from the daily CDD based on the CTHI, rather than the temperature, 
in order to capture the effects of humidity.  Further, the TDD was calculated as the maximum 
monthly value of this variable rather than the value coinciding with the peak demand. 
 
Figure 18 is a scatter plot of NY State Daily energy (retail usage plus losses) plotted against 
average daily temperature, in which each point represents a day.  The relationship is clearly 
non-linear.  Specifically, there is a positive relationship between energy and temperature at 
temperatures above 65 degrees (i.e., high temperatures are associated with higher energy) 
and there is a negative relationship between energy and temperature at temperatures below 
50 degrees (i.e., lower temperatures are associated with higher energy).  This relationship is 
well-known and easily explained.  At high temperatures, electricity consumers use more 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 22 
  
 
energy for cooling.  At low temperatures, electricity consumers use more energy for heating.  
Further, the lower temperatures are also associated with increased lighting usage as the 
winter has longer periods of darkness. 
Figure 18: NY State Daily Energy vs. Average Temperature (2006 to 2018) 
 
 
From the above figure, it is clear that using a single breakpoint of 65 for both CDD and HDD 
will not provide the best fit.  While 65 degrees is a reasonable breakpoint for CDD, HDD 
defined with a 55 or even 50 degrees, will fit the heating side of the curve much better.  Less 
obvious is that using a single breakpoint for CDD alone (and for HDD alone) may not 
sufficiently capture the load-weather relationship, due to the non-linear response of load to 
weather.  To address this weakness, we develop weighted CDD and HDD values that 
incorporate differential effects at various breakpoints.

weights is 1.0. 
 
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 23 
  
 
Analogous weighting logic applies to the monthly HDD. 
 
Figure 19 depicts the relationship between NY state monthly peak demand against the peak-
day CTHI — each point represents the peak-day during the month, with one point per month.  
The relationship is very similar to the relationship between daily energy and temperature.  
 
Figure 19: NY State Monthly Peak Demand vs. Peak Day CTHI (2006 to 2018) 
 
 
For the purposes of modeling the monthly peak-demand, we calculated the CTHI on the day 
of the historical peak.  That is, we determined the day on which the monthly peak demand 
occurred, and we calculated the CTHI from that particular day.  We then utilized the CTHI as 
the basis for the TDD (analogous to the CDD), rather than using the temperature solely, in 
order to capture the effects of humidity.  Further, we applied a similar weighting as described 
above for the monthly CDD and HDD variables, in order to capture non-linearities in the 
effects of the TDD.  Figure 20 illustrates the NY State monthly peak TDD variable. 
 
Figure 20: NY State Peak TDD History and Forecast

Trended CDD, HDD, and CTHI are used in constructing drivers for the forecast models.  At 
the end of the process, the monthly CDD values increase during the forecast horizon and the 
monthly HDD values decrease during the forecast horizon, as shown in Figure 21 and Figure 
22.  The CDD values exhibit an increase of 0.8% annually (with a faster increase during the 
shoulder months than during the peak summer months), while the HDD values decrease by 
0.5% annually.

3.4 Accelerated Temperature Scenario 
Average temperatures are trending upward by 0.6 to 0.9 degrees per decade at weather 
stations across the state.  On average, New York temperatures are increasing 0.7 degrees per 
decade.  Temperature trends are consistent with current and projected increases in 
greenhouse gases at least through 2030.  Our reference case assumption is temperatures will 
continue to trend at current rates.  AccuWeather, who worked with Itron on the study, 
confirmed the reasonableness of projected temperature trends. 
 
Climate-model projections are based on one of four RCP paths.  NYSERDA, New York City 
and Consolidated Edison base their analysis on RCP 4.5 (as the low case) and RCP 8.5 (as 
the high case). RCP 8.5 results in significantly higher long-term temperatures.  There is no 
significant divergence in the RCP paths until 2030; the paths are roughly linear from 2000 
through 2030.  After 2030, RCP 8.5 (the worst-case scenario) begins to significantly 
accelerate. RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 trend at the current rate until 2060, at which point RCP 6.0 
continues at the current trend while RCP 4.5 flattens out.  Greenhouse gas concentration 
under RCP 2.6 (the best-case secnerio) starts declining after 2040.  On a long-term basis, 
greenhouse gas concentrations are relatively consistent between RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0. 
 
We recognize that there is uncertainty as to which path we will ultimately follow.  To bound 
this uncertainty, we developed an “accelerated” temperature case.  The accelerated scenario 
doubles the average temperature increase from 0.7 degrees per decade to 1.4 degrees per 
decade.  The high range is consistent with the state climate study high range temperature 
projections.  AccuWeather confirmed that 1.4 degrees per decade represents an extreme 
temperature outcome. 
 
The accelerated daily temperature series is derived in a similar manner as that for the 
trended-normal data series; we assume that the hottest temperatures and coldest day 
temperatures are also increasing twice as fast as in the Reference Case.  The temperature 
duration curve shifts out over time at 1.4 degrees per decade with results used in constructing 
spline-weighed CDD, HDD and peak-day TDD. 
 
Figure 23 through Figure 25 compare HDDs, CDDs, and peak-day TDDs for the Reference 
Case and the accelerated weather trend scenario.

3.5 Load Impacts 
System and zonal load forecasts are based on a set of models and assumptions on future 
demographic, economic, structural, and weather conditions.  The models are described in 
Section 4.  The reference case (one of the three forecast scenarios) is used to evaluate 
climate-change impacts.  The reference case is based on the NYISO 2019 Gold Book forecast 
assumptions and trended-normal (0.7 degrees per decade) temperature projections.  The 
reference case model is also used to estimate energy and peak demand with accelerated (1.4 
degrees per decade) and “normal” temperatures (temperatures held constant at the 2019 
level).  Table 5 shows forecast results. 
 
Table 5: System Peak Demand Impact 
 
 
Reference case summer peak demand reaches 37,403 MW in 2040 and 43,317 MW in 2050. 
Reference case peak demand is 1,007 MW higher than the normal case demand forecast by 
2040, and over 1,600 MW higher by 2050.  Using the accelerated temperature projections 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 28 
  
 
more than doubles the demand impact.  With accelerated temperatures, peak demand reaches 
45,479 MW by 2050 - 3,779 MW higher than the normal-weather forecast.   
 
As a percent of total peak demand, the weather impacts do not appear to be all that 
significant.  The impact is much more significant when compared against cooling load at 
time of peak; roughly 40% of the peak load is cooling related.  Climate change accounts for 
7% to 17% of projected cooling load by 2040 and 10% to 23% by 2050.   
 
Projected demands are based on trended and accelerated weather projections. Even around 
these trends, there are a range of possible outcomes due to uncertainty inherent in model 
structure and statistical estimation process, economic and end-use intensity forecasts, and 
with the largest contributor being variance in peak-day weather conditions.  To bound 
forecast uncertain, a 90% confidence interval is statistically derived as the 45th percentile 
above and below the 50th percentile demand forecast (corresponding to the 5th percentile and 
95th percentile forecasts, respectively). Table 6 shows the 50% and 90% upper bound of the 
demand forecasts for the Reference and Accelerated Cases. 
 
 NYISO also performs analyses for a one-in-ten (90th percentile) possible load event. For 
comparison, Table 6 also shows the current NYISO Gold Book forecasts.   
 
Table 6: 50% and 90% Percentile Forecast 
 
 
While the Reference Case forecast is based on the same set of underlying economic and end-
use intensity projections, expected demand (50% probability) is also higher than Gold Book 
Baseline forecast.  This is largely due to differences in peak-day temperature variable 
construction, peak-day temperature trend, and approaches for modeling impact of solar and 
electric vehicle loads on the system load profile.

4. Model Overview 
Despite moderate economic growth over the last ten years, state electric sales have been flat 
to slightly declining.  This is primarily because improvements in end-use efficiency have 
countered the impacts of customer and economic growth.  NYISO recognized this issue and 
three years ago adopted an end-use modeling framework designed to explicitly account for 
changes in energy efficiency as well as economic growth.  The NYISO modeling framework 
is used in developing the climate impact forecasts. 
 
For the system forecast, the approach starts at the customer-class level with monthly 
forecasts of residential, commercial, industrial, and streetlight sales.  Residential and 
commercial customer classes are modeled using an end-use framework that explicitly 
incorporate end-use saturation and efficiency.  Generalized econometric models are used in 
developing the industrial and street lighting forecast.  Non-weather sensitive end-use sales 
estimates derived from class-level forecasts are used to forecast system peak.  Impact of 
trending weather conditions on peak are captured through the peak model heating and 
cooling variables that also incorporate heating and cooling end-use intensity projections, 
population, and economic growth. 
 
The peak forecast and energy forecast (derived by adjusting the sales forecast for line losses) 
are combined with a system hourly profile load forecast.  The profile reflects expected daily 
weather conditions, day of the week, seasons, and holidays.  The result is an 8,760 baseline 
hourly load forecast through 2050.   
 
Long-term hourly load forecasts for solar, electric vehicles, and electrification (e.g., cold 
climate heat pumps) are layered on the baseline hourly load forecast.  Figure 26 shows the 
modeling framework.

Figure 26: System Load Model Overview 
 
 
4.1 Sales and Energy Forecasts  
In the long-term, both economic growth and structural changes drive energy and demand 
requirements.  Structural changes are captured in the residential and commercial sales 
forecast models through SAE (Statistically Adjusted End-Use) specifications.  The SAE 
model explicitly incorporates end-use saturation and efficiency projections, thermal shell 
integrity, as well as changes in population, economic activity, prices, and weather.  End-use 
efficiency projections include the expected impact of standards, naturally occurring 
efficiency gains, and utility efficiency (EE) programs such rebates and thermal shell 
improvement programs.  Figure 27 shows the SAE model specification.  A detailed 
description of the SAE model is included in Appendix B.

Figure 27: Statistically Adjusted End-Use (SAE) Model Overview 
 
 
Monthly estimates of cooling (XCool), heating (XHeat), and other use (XOther) are derived 
from historical and projected end-use saturation and stock efficiency (energy intensities), 
economic drivers, and trended CDD and HDD.  A set of coefficients (bc, bh, and bo) are 
estimated using linear regression that statistically calibrate end-use energy estimates to 
monthly billed sales.  Models are estimated from reported state-level sales and customer data 
from January 2009 through December 2018. 
 
End-use intensities are derived from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).  EIA provides 
historical and forecasted estimates of appliance saturation, average stock efficiency, and total 
stock consumption.  In the residential sector there are three housing types (single family, 
multi-family, and mobile home) and seventeen end-uses.  Indices are weighted for the state 
and each transmission operating area based on the housing mix.  In the commercial sector 
there are eleven building types and nine primary end-uses.  End-use saturations for the Mid-
Atlantic Census Division are then calibrated to New York end-use saturation survey data.  
Separate weighted commercial end-use intensities are estimated for New York City and Long 
Island based on available commercial data for these regions. Figure 28 and Figure 29 show 
end-use intensities for total heating, cooling, and base (non-weather sensitive) use.

The strong decline in near-term residential intensity is largely the result of LED lighting 
adoption.  After 2030, residential base-use shows slight positive growth as there are currently 
no additional scheduled appliance standards.  Strong declines in commercial base intensities 
are largely the outcome of improvements in commercial lighting (conversion to LED lighting 
systems) and improvements in ventilation.  Heating is relatively small across the residential 
and commercial sectors as the majority of state households and business heat with natural 
gas.  
 
4.2 Economic Projections 
The economic forecast is based on Moody Analytics 2018 long-term economic outlook for 
New York.  Economic drivers include the number of households and household income in 
the residential sector, and GDP and employment in the commercial and industrial sectors.  
The industrial model also includes a measure of efficiency (kWh per employee) derived from 
the EIA’s annual U.S. industrial sales outlook.  Table 7 and Table 8 show the state economic 
variables for the residential and non-residential sectors.  Transmission District level forecasts 
are based on associated regional economic forecasts.

Projected state economic growth is simlar to the last ten years with little population, 
household, and employment growth.  Long-term state GDP growth is positive but increases 
at slower rate than the most recent ten years. 
 
Declines in end-use energy intensities combined with moderate economic growth result in a 
flat to slightly negative sales trend.  While increasing temperatures overall contribute to sales 
growth, the increase in cooling loads are partially offset by decreases in heating-related sales. 
Heating loads include a small amount of electric heat, backup electric heat, and fans and 
pumps associated with gas and other fossil fuel heating systems.  Sales trend upward around 
2045 as there are no additional impacts from end-use standards after this time.  Figure 30 
shows the Reference Case baseline energy forecast.

4.3 Peak Demand Forecast 
Peak Demand is driven by underlying energy requirements.  A standard modeling approach 
is to find the historical relationship between peak and energy (either a load factor or with a 
linear regression model) and to assume this relationship holds through the forecast period.  
While this is sufficient for a short-term period, the relationship between energy and peaks 
changes further into the forecast horizon, as the peak hour load depends on the timing and 
relative size of the underlying end-use loads.  We would expect increasing temperatures to 
have a significant impact on summer peaks as approximately 40% of the load at time of peak 
is cooling related.  Changes in lighting requirements as a result of LED market penetration 
have a larger impact on winter peak than summer peak as there is more lighting use at time of 
winter peak.  To the extent possible, we want to capture changing load dynamics in the peak 
forecast.  Figure 31 shows the peak modeling framework.

Figure 31: Peak Model Framework 
 
 
Monthly peak demand is driven by end-use load estimates derived from the customer class 
sales forecast models.  Other Use is disggregated to end-use estimates at time of peak 
(PkOther).  The peak-day cooling (PkCool) and heating (PkHeat) variables are constructed 
by combining residential and commercial cooling and heating requirements with trended 
peak-day degree-days.  The coefficients bc, bh, and bo are estiamted with linear regression. 
The model is estimated over the period January 2009 to December 2018.  Figure 32 shows 
baseline peak demand forecast.

Figure 32: Baseline Peak Forecast (Reference Case) 
 
 
Increasing peak-day TDD contributes to strong summer peak demand growth while declining 
peak-day HDD reduces winter peak demand. 
 
Table 9 presents the baseline energy and peak forecast for the Reference Case.  Baseline 
forecast includes state economic projections, EIA end-use intensity trends projections, and  
increase in temperatures (0.7 degrees per decade). 
 
Table 9: Baseline Forecast (Reference Case) 
 
 
Total system energy is relatively flat as efficiency improvements counter household and 
economic growth and the impact of increasing CDD are mitigated by decreasing HDD. 
 
The baseline end-use forecast is adjusted downward for expected BTM solar adoption and 
upward for electric vehicle charging loads.  BTM solar and electric vehicle charging 
forecasts were developed as part of the NYISO 2019 Gold Book Forecast.

A BTM solar forecast is developed for each load zone.  The forecast of installed solar PV 
capacity is based on a model that fits historical adoption trends with a logistic S-shape curve. 
GWh generation is then derived based on the expected solar PV installed capacity (MW) and 
the solar PV annual capacity factor.  We expect to see strong solar adoption through 2030.  In 
the Reference Case, solar generation doubles from 2,647 GWh in 2020 to 5,223 GWh in 
2030.  BTM solar generation continues to increase in subsequent year but at a slower rate, as 
the potential market flattens out.  
 
The electric vehicle forecast starts with a projection of total registered vehicles. The 
historical number of registered vehicles are first obtained from county registars. Future total 
vehicles  are based on the historical relationship of the number of registered vehicles and 
regional population.  Moody’s regional population forecasts then drive total vehicle forecast 
forward. Electric vehicle saturation projections (the number of electric cars as a share of total 
vehicles in a given year) are based on National Energy Renewable Laboratory (NREL) U.S. 
electric vehicle projections for “all electric” (Battery Electric Vehicle or BEV) and hybrid 
electric vehicles (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles or PHEV). PHEV have a much lower 
kWh per mile input than BEV, since they also combust gasoline. 
 
The changing mix of BEV and PHEV is reflected in the kWh per vehicle forecast. The kWh 
per vehicle increases over time with increasing share of BEV adoption and decreasing share 
of PHEV.  A simple model is used to translate electric vehicle purchases to annual charging 
energy requirements: 
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺ℎ𝑡𝑡= 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 × 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡× ൬𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ
𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡൰ 
Where: 
EV Units 
= Forecasted number of electric vehicles by type 
VMT   
= Annual vehicle miles traveled 
kWh/mile  
= Expected annual kWh use per vehicle mile 
weighted across vehicle class/type 
EIF  
= Efficiency Improvement Factor; an index that 
reflects increased efficiency of electric vehicles 
over time 
t  
= Index representing the year 
 
 
By 2030 electric vehicles (both BEV and PHEV) account for 14% of passenger electric 
vehicles and light duty trucks; this increases to nearly 40% by 2040.  With the additional 
penetration of commercial electric vehicles (representing medium and heavy dutry trucks and 
buses), the total EV sales reach 13,174 GWh by 2040 and 24,360 GWh by 2050.   
Commercial electric vehicle sales are estimated using the same approach as that for 
passenger vehicles. Estimates of bus and large vehicle mileage and required electricity input 
(kWh/mile) are based on a number of data sources including Columbia University, National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), New York State Energy Research and Development 
Agency (NYSERDA) and the California Energy Commission (CEC).

4.4 Baseline Hourly Load Forecast 
Adoption of new technologies including solar, electric vehicles, and cold climate heat pumps 
will significantly impact the system hourly load and as a result the timing and level of system 
peak demand.  Increases in solar load, for example, shift the summer peak later into the day 
and eventually into the early evening.  Aggressive market penetration of cold climate heat 
pumps could shift the system peak from summer to winter.  An hourly load modeling 
approach is used to capture the changing load dynamics.  The process starts by first 
developing a baseline hourly load forecast. 
 
The system profile is estimated with historical system hourly load (adjusted for solar load 
impacts).  The model relates hourly loads to daily degree-days, hours of light, and variables 
that capture day of the week, holidays, and other seaonsal changes.  The baseline profiles 
change over time with increasing CDD and HDD.  The system profile is extended through 
2050.  The baseline hourly load forecast is then calculated by combining the system profile 
forecast with the baseline energy and peak demand forecasts.  Figure 33 illustrates this 
process.

4.5 Adjusting for New Technologies 
In the Reference Case, the baseline hourly load forecast is adjusted for BTM PV, EV, and a 
small amount of battery storage.  Forecasts are generated by combining these technology 
energy forecasts with their hourly load profiles.  A typical solar load profile is derived from 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The electric vehicle charging profile is 
based on measured charging data from a study completed by Idaho National Laboratories for 
the Nashville Metropolitan Area.  Figure 34 and Figure 35 show summer BTM PV and EV 
hourly load forecast for the week of July 22nd in 2040.

The Reference Case adjusted system load forecast is calculated by adding the electric vehicle 
hourly load forecast and subtracting out solar and battery hourly load forecasts.  Figure 36 
shows how adjustments for BTM solar and electric vehicles reshape system load over time.

Note that by 2040, the solar load impact is insignificant as the peak demand has shifted later 
into the evening largely as the result of increased EV charging.  For comparison to coincident 
peaks, Table 12 shows the maximum baseline, solar, EV, and battery demand.

5. Forecast Scenarios 
Two forecast scenarios are designed to incorporate recent state policy goals.  The Policy 
Scenario assumes the State Clean Energy Standards (CES) Goal is met.  In addition to 
renewable generation targets, the CES sets new energy efficiency, solar capacity, and battery 
storage targets for 2025.   
 
The Policy Scenario includes: 
 
• State average temperature trending 0.7 degrees per decade 
• An additional 2,200 GWh per year in EE savings over the Reference Case 
• A total of 6,000 MW of behind-the-meter solar capacity by 2025 and an additional 
3,000 MW through 2050 
• Implementation of state electrification programs with 25% of existing homes 
converting from fossil fuel to cold climate heat pumps by 2050 
• 3,000 MW of battery storage by 2030, 5,000 MW by 2050 (battery load impacts 
included in the Reference Case will be treated as a resource during the system 
planning phase of the study – not as a load reduction) 
• Stronger electric vehicle market penetration than the Reference Case 
 
In July 2019, the State passed the Climate Leadership & Community Protection Act 
(CLCPA).  The CLCPA establishes aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals with a target 
of 85% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050.  The CLCPA Scenario is based on achieving 
targeted emission reductions in the residential and commercial sectors.   
 
The CLCPA Scenario builds on the Policy Case.  In addition to higher Policy Case efficiency 
savings, solar capacity and electric vehicle penetration, the CLCPA adds aggressive 
electrification in residential and commercial sectors. The largest targeted end-use is 
residential fossil fuel heating; we assume gas, oil, and propane heating systems are replaced 
with cold climate heat pumps with electric resistance backup to meet heating requirements on 
the coldest days. Other targeted end-uses including water heating, clothes drying, and 
cooking. 
 
The process of estimating electricity gains from electrification programs starts with estimates 
of sector-specific CO2 reduction goals.  In July 2019, NYSERDA updated the state 
greenhouse gas inventory (New York State Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 – 2016. Final 
Report. July 2019).  The report estimates greenhouse gas emissions associated with a wide 
range of human-related activities.  Table 13 summarizes the NYSERDA greenhouse gas 
emissions and trends.   
 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 44 
  
 
Table 13: New York State Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NYSERDA) 
 
New York State Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 – 2016. Final Report. July 2019 
 
In 1990 (the target year), NYSERDA estimates that greenhouse gases in total were 236.19 
million metric tons, with the Residential sector contributing 34.25 million metric tons.  By 
2050, assuming that greenhouse gas reductions are evenly distributed across all levels of 
activity, the residential greenhouse gas target reduction is 29.1 million metric tons (85% of 
90 level) resulting in a 2050 emissions level of 5.1 million metric tons.  Fortunately, since 
1990, greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing.  By 2016, residential direct 
greenhouse gas emissions were 30.89 million metric tons. This still leaves the need to reduce 
residential greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 25.8 million tons by 2050. Figure 37 
shows a possible path towards the reduction of greenhouse gases in the residential sector.

5.1 Energy Impacts 
To achieve the greenhouse gas emission target for the residential sector, over 6,000,000 
households would have to switch from gas heat to electric heat by 2050. Other end-uses 
would also need to be converted, including water heating, clothes drying and cooking. 
 
We assume fossil fuel heating is converted to cold climate heat pumps with resistance heat 
backup, gas water heaters are converted to electric water heaters, gas dryers are converted to 
electric dryers, and gas stoves are converted to electric stoves.  Total electrification sales are 
then estimated as the product of units converted to electricity times the end-use electricity 
energy requirements (UEC). Electrification reflects improving end-use efficiency that is 
embedded in the UEC forecast.  Figure 39 shows resulting end-use electric sales gains. 
 
Figure 39: Residential Electrification Impact Forecast 
 
 
By far, the largest impact is conversion of fossil fuel heating systems to heat pumps and 
resistance heating backup or secondary heating.  Figure 40 compares residential average use 
for the Reference, Policy, and CLCPA Scenarios.

Figure 40: Residential Average Use Forecast 
 
 
The Reference Case average use (shown in blue) declines over the next ten years, as gains in 
efficiency outweigh household income growth and rising temperatures.  Rising temperatures 
impact on sales is minimal as increases in cooling use are countered with decreasing space 
and water heating use.  After 2030 average use shows small, but positive increases largely 
due to slower improvements in end-use stock efficiency.  For example, LED lighting 
adoption is a major contributor to declining usage through 2030.  By 2030, LED is expected 
to be the dominant lighting technology; the impact of additional lighting efficiency after this 
point is small. 
 
The Policy Scenario (shown in orange) is driven largely by CES efficiency targets; average 
use falls significantly between 2020 and 2030 and then shows positive growth with 
electrification.  The increase in usage due to electrification is still not large enough to counter 
decreases in usage caused by energy efficiency savings. The CLPCA Scenario (in Green) 
includes the Policy Scenario efficiency projections but incorporates a much more aggressive 
electrification program.  Average use per household increases from approximately 7,000 
kWh in 2020 to 11,000 kWh in 2050.   
 
The residential sales forecast is calculated as the product of average use per customer and the 
state household forecast (number of households).  Figure 41 shows the residential sales 
forecast.

Project time constraints limited our ability to conduct the same CLCPA end-use impact study 
for the commercial sector.  We assume electric sales gains from commercial gas conversions 
are similar in proportion to residential electrification, based on similar size in total energy 
usage in the two sectors, and similar proportions of heating and cooling end uses.  Figure 42 
shows the commercial sales forecast.

Reference Case commercial sales are consistent with historical sales; the impact of economic 
growth and increasing temperatures are mitigated by increases in commercial efficiency. The 
forecast reflects EIA’s projection for strong efficiency gains in commercial lighting, 
ventilation, and other end-uses.  
 
Declining sales in the Policy Scenario are again driven by CES energy efficiency savings 
target; efficiency gains outweigh economic growth and increasing temperatures.  In the 
CLCPA Scenario, sales increase dramatically after 2030 as a result of aggressive 
electrification.  While we account for improving efficiency in the industrial sector, we make 
no adjustment for electrification as we have little information on industrial end-use processes 
and to what extent processes currently dependent on natural gas can be converted to electric 
processes.  Figure 43 depicts system energy forecast including the current Gold Book 
forecast. 
 
Figure 43:  System Energy Forecast 
 
 
The Reference Case is consistent with the current Gold Book forecast.  The Policy Case is 
lower as additional EE savings and PV adoption outweigh gains from electric vehicles and 
electrification.  After 2030, CLCPA forecast is significantly higher than the Reference Case 
largely driven by aggressive statewide electrification.  
 
Table 14 shows forecast results by technology.  Energy efficiency impacts are embedded in 
the baseline energy forecasts.

5.2 Demand Impacts 
Demand impacts from the Policy and CLCPA scenarios are estimated by combining baseline, 
BTM solar, electric vehicle, and electrification hourly load forecasts.  The derivation is 
similar to the development of the Reference Case hourly load and peak demand forecast.  
Additional CLCPA EE savings are captured in the baseline hourly load forecast, higher solar 
load projections are derived by combining Policy Case solar generation forecast with the 
solar hourly load profile, and EV hourly load forecast is calculated by combining higher EV 
charging energy with EV charging profile. 
 
As electrification has a significant impact on heating loads, electrification impacts are 
modeled outside the baseline load forecast.  Separate end-use profiles are developed for 
residential and commercial heating, cooling, and base-use.  Profiles are derived from AMI 
data from an adjoining state.  Base, cooling, and heating load models are estimated with host 
data and used to simulate load profiles with New York actual and trended degree-days.  This 
is often referred to as a transfer model.  An electrification hourly load forecast is calculated 
by combining heating, cooling, and base-use electrification sales with heating, cooling, and 
base-use load profiles.  Figure 44 shows the electrification hourly load forecasts for 2040.

While the Gold Book energy and Reference Case energy forecasts track each other, the 
Reference Case peak demand is significantly higher than the Gold Book peak demand. This 
is largely due to the trended peak-day TDD incorporated in the Reference Case Scenario.  
The Policy Case summer demand declines through 2025 as a result of CES energy efficiency 
targets.  With stronger EV adoption and electrification through in the later years, Policy peak 
demand reaches the Reference Case peak demand by 2048. 
 
The system peaks in the summer over the entire forecast horizon except for in the CLCPA 
Scenario.  The CLCPA peak demand forecast switches to a winter peak in 2035. Figure 47 
compares the winter peak forecasts.

6. Zonal Load Forecasts 
Hourly load forecasts are also developed for each of the NYISO Load Zones.  Hourly load 
forecasts are first estimated for each of the Transmission Districts (TD) and then allocated to 
NYISO planning zones based on a set of TD-to-zonal allocation factors. 
 
Forecast structure is similar to the system forecast, but rather than build-up from class sales, 
TD models are estimated at the total energy level, because the NYISO has total hourly loads 
for each TD.  Forecast drivers account for regional economic growth, mix of residential and 
non-residential customers, expected weather trends due to climate change. For Consolidated 
Edison, the residential end-use intensity projections reflect the higher share of multi-family 
housing in that system. Monthly energy, peak demand, and baseline hourly load profiles are 
estimated for each TD.  Model inputs include: 
 
• Historical TD hourly load data 
• TD-specific historical and trended temperature projections 
• Weighted residential and commercial heating, cooling, and other use energy 
intensities 
• TD-specific historical and projected monthly economic data from Moodys Analytics. 
 
Figure 48 shows the TD/Zonal model structure.

Energy, peak demand, and hourly profile are combined to generate a baseline hourly load 
forecast through 2050. TD baseline load forecasts are then calibrated to the system baseline 
hourly load forecast, after which the zonal forecasts are produced. 
Forecasts are also adjusted for PV, EV, and electrification impacts.  State-level PV 
generation, EV charging load, and electrification sales are allocated to TDs based on the 
NYISO 2019 Gold Book forecast.  Results are then allocated to the NYISO load zones.  
Hourly load forecasts are generated for the Reference, Policy and CLCPA Scenarios.  Zonal 
results are provided in Appendix A.

Appendix B:  SAE Modeling Framework  
B-1 Residential Sector 
The traditional approach to forecasting monthly sales for a customer class is to develop an 
econometric model that relates monthly sales to weather, seasonal variables, and economic 
conditions.  From a forecasting perspective, econometric models are well suited to identify 
historical trends and to project these trends into the future.  In contrast, the strength of the 
end-use modeling approach is the ability to identify the end-use factors that drive energy use.  
By incorporating an end-use structure into an econometric model, the statistically adjusted 
end-use (SAE) modeling framework exploits the strengths of both approaches.  
 
There are several advantages to this approach. 
 
• The equipment efficiency and saturation trends, dwelling square footage, and 
thermal shell integrity changes embodied in the long-run end-use forecasts are 
introduced explicitly into the short-term monthly sales forecast.  This provides a 
strong bridge between the two forecasts. 
• By explicitly introducing trends in equipment saturations, equipment efficiency, 
dwelling square footage, and thermal integrity levels, it is easier to explain 
changes in usage levels and changes in weather-sensitivity over time. 
• Data for short-term models are often not sufficiently robust to support estimation 
of a full set of price, economic, and demographic effects.  By bundling these 
factors with equipment-oriented drivers, a rich set of elasticities can be 
incorporated into the final model. 
 
This section describes the SAE approach, the associated supporting SAE spreadsheets, and 
the MetrixND project files that are used in the implementation.  The initial source for the SAE 
spreadsheets is the 2019 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) database provided by the Energy 
Information Administration (EIA), with further adjustments to data specific to New York 
when that is available. 
 
B-1.1 Residential Statistically Adjusted End-Use Modeling Framework 
The statistically adjusted end-use modeling framework begins by defining energy use 
(USEy,m) in year (y) and month (m) as the sum of energy used by heating equipment (Heaty,m), 
cooling equipment (Cooly,m), and other equipment (Othery,m).  Formally,

Although monthly sales are measured for individual customers, the end-use components are 
not.  Substituting estimates for the end-use elements gives the following econometric 
equation.

XHeatm, XCoolm, and XOtherm are explanatory variables constructed from end-use 
information, dwelling data, weather data, and market data.  As will be shown below, the 
equations used to construct these X-variables are simplified end-use models, and the X-
variables are the estimated usage levels for each of the major end uses based on these 
models.  The estimated model can then be thought of as a statistically adjusted end-use 
model, where the estimated slopes are the adjustment factors. 
 
B-1.2 Constructing XHeat 
As represented in the SAE spreadsheets, energy use by space heating systems depends on the 
following types of variables. 
 
• Heating degree days 
• Heating equipment saturation levels 
• Heating equipment operating efficiencies 
• Average number of days in the billing cycle for each month 
• Thermal integrity and footage of homes 
• Average household size, household income, and energy prices 
 
The heating variable is represented as the product of an annual equipment index and a 
monthly usage multiplier.  That is,

Where: 
• XHeaty,m  is estimated heating energy use in year (y) and month (m)  
• HeatIndexy,m  is the monthly index of heating equipment 
• HeatUsey,m  is the monthly usage multiplier 
 
The heating equipment index is defined as a weighted average across equipment types of 
equipment saturation levels normalized by operating efficiency levels.  Given a set of fixed 
weights, the index will change over time with changes in equipment saturations (Sat), 
operating efficiencies (Eff), building structural index (StructuralIndex), and energy prices.  
Formally, the equipment index is defined as:

The StructuralIndex is constructed by combining the EIA’s building shell efficiency index 
trends with surface area estimates, and then it is indexed to the 2015 value:

The StructuralIndex is defined on the StructuralVars tab of the SAE spreadsheets.  Surface 
area is derived to account for roof and wall area of a standard dwelling based on the regional 
average square footage data obtained from EIA.  The relationship between the square footage 
and surface area is constructed assuming an aspect ratio of 0.75 and an average of 25% two-
story and 75% single-story.  Given these assumptions, the approximate linear relationship for 
surface area is:

In Equation 4, 2015 is used as a base year for normalizing the index.  As a result, the ratio on 
the right is equal to 1.0 in 2015.  In other years, it will be greater than 1.0 if equipment 
saturation levels are above their 2015 level.  This will be counteracted by higher efficiency 
levels, which will drive the index downward.  The weights are defined as follows.

In the SAE spreadsheets, these weights are referred to as Intensities and are defined on the 
EIAData tab.  With these weights, the HeatIndex value in 2015 will be equal to estimated 
annual heating intensity per household in that year.  Variations from this value in other years 
will be proportional to saturation and efficiency variations around their base values.

For electric heating equipment, the SAE spreadsheets contain several equipment types 
including electric resistance furnaces, secondary heating equipment (such as portable 
heaters), and electric space heating heat pumps. 
 
Data for the equipment saturation and efficiency trends are presented on the Shares and 
Efficiencies tabs of the SAE spreadsheets.  The efficiency for electric space heating heat 
pumps is given in terms of Heating Seasonal Performance Factor [BTU/Wh], and the 
efficiencies for electric furnaces and room units are estimated as 100%, which is equivalent 
to 3.41 BTU/Wh. 
 
Heating system usage levels are impacted on a monthly basis by several factors, including 
weather, household size, income levels, prices, and billing days.  The estimates for space 
heating equipment usage levels are computed as follows:

Where: 
 
• RHD is the number of heating degree days in year (y) and month (m) for the 
residential model.  
• HHSize is average persons per household in a year (y) 
• Income is average real income per household in year (y) 
 
By construction, the HeatUsey,m variable has an annual sum that is close to 1.0 in the base 
year (2015).  The heating degree days serve to allocate annual values to months of the year.  
The remaining terms average to 1.0 in the base year.  In other years, the values will reflect 
changes in the economic drivers, as transformed through the end-use elasticity parameters.  
The income impacts captured by the Usage equation represent short-term income response. 
 
B-1.3 Constructing XCool 
The explanatory variable for cooling loads is constructed in a similar manner.  The amount of 
energy used by cooling systems depends on the following types of variables.   
 
• Cooling degree days 
• Cooling equipment saturation levels 
• Cooling equipment operating efficiencies 
• Average number of days in the billing cycle for each month  
• Thermal integrity and footage of homes 
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 205 
  
 
• Average household size, household income, and energy prices

Where

• CoolIndexy is an index of cooling equipment 
• CoolUsey,m is the monthly usage multiplier 
 
As with heating, the cooling equipment index is defined as a weighted average across 
equipment types of equipment saturation levels normalized by operating efficiency levels. 
Formally, the cooling equipment index is defined as:

Data values in 2015 are used as a base year for normalizing the index, and the ratio on the 
right is equal to 1.0 in 2015.  In other years, it will be greater than 1.0 if equipment saturation 
levels are above their 2015 level.  This will be counteracted by higher efficiency levels, 
which will drive the index downward.  The weights are defined as follows.

For cooling equipment, the SAE spreadsheets contain several equipment types including 
central air conditioners, space cooling heat pumps, and room air conditioners.   
 
The equipment saturation and efficiency trends data are presented on the Shares and 
Efficiencies tabs of the SAE spreadsheets.  The efficiency for space cooling heat pumps and 
central air conditioning (A/C) units are given in terms of Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 
[BTU/Wh], and room A/C units efficiencies are given in terms of Energy Efficiency Ratio 
[BTU/Wh]. 
 
Cooling system usage levels are impacted on a monthly basis by several factors, including 
weather, household size, income levels, and prices.  The estimates of cooling equipment

By construction, the CoolUse variable has an annual sum that is close to 1.0 in the base year 
(2015).  The cooling degree days serve to allocate annual values to months of the year.  The 
remaining terms average to 1.0 in the base year.  In other years, the values will change to 
reflect changes in the economic driver changes. 
 
B-1.4 Constructing XOther 
Monthly estimates of non-weather sensitive sales can be derived in a similar fashion to space 
heating and cooling.  Based on end-use concepts, other sales are driven by: 
 
• Appliance and equipment saturation levels 
• Appliance efficiency levels 
• Average number of days in the billing cycle for each month 
• Average household size, real income, and real prices

• UEC is the unit energy consumption for appliances 
 
This index combines information about trends in saturation levels and efficiency levels for 
the main appliance categories with monthly multipliers for lighting, water heating, and 
refrigeration. 
 
The appliance saturation and efficiency trends data are presented on the Shares and

B-2 Commercial Sector 
The traditional approach to forecasting monthly sales for a customer class is to develop an 
econometric model that relates monthly sales to weather, seasonal variables, and economic 
conditions.  From a forecasting perspective, the strength of econometric models is that they 
are well suited to identifying historical trends and to projecting these trends into the future.  
In contrast, the strength of the end-use modeling approach is the ability to identify the end-
use factors that are driving energy use.  By incorporating an end-use structure into an 
econometric model, the statistically adjusted end-use (SAE) modeling framework exploits 
the strengths of both approaches.  
 
There are several advantages to this approach. 
 
• The equipment efficiency trends and saturation changes embodied in the long-run 
end-use forecasts are introduced explicitly into the short-term monthly sales 
forecast.  This provides a strong bridge between the two forecasts. 
 
• By explicitly introducing trends in equipment saturations and equipment efficiency 
levels, it is easier to explain changes in usage levels and changes in weather-
sensitivity over time.  
 
• Data for short-term models are often not sufficiently robust to support estimation 
of a full set of price, economic, and demographic effects.  By bundling these 
factors with equipment-oriented drivers, a rich set of elasticities can be built into 
the final model. 
 
This document describes this approach, the associated supporting Commercial SAE 
spreadsheets, and MetrixND project files that are used in the implementation. The source for 
the commercial SAE spreadsheets is the 2019 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) database 
provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), with further adjustments to data 
specific to New York when that is available.

B-2.1 Commercial Statistically Adjusted End-Use Model Framework 
The commercial statistically adjusted end-use model framework begins by defining energy 
use (USEy,m) in year (y) and month (m) as the sum of energy used by heating equipment 
(Heaty,m), cooling equipment (Cooly,m) and other equipment (Othery,m).  Formally,

Here, XHeatm, XCoolm, and XOtherm are explanatory variables constructed from end-use 
information, weather data, and market data.  As will be shown below, the equations used to 
construct these X-variables are simplified end-use models, and the X-variables are the 
estimated usage levels for each of the major end uses based on these models.  The estimated 
model can then be thought of as a statistically adjusted end-use model, where the estimated 
slopes are the adjustment factors.   
 
 
B-2.2 Constructing XHeat 
As represented in the Commercial SAE spreadsheets, energy use by space heating systems 
depends on the following types of variables.   
 
 
Heating degree days, 
 
Heating equipment saturation levels, 
 
Heating equipment operating efficiencies, 
 
Average number of days in the billing cycle for each month, and 
 
Commercial output and energy price. 
 
The heating variable is represented as the product of an annual equipment index and a 
monthly usage multiplier.  That is,

where, XHeaty,m is estimated heating energy use in year (y) and month (m),  
HeatIndexy is the annual index of heating equipment, and  
 
NYISO Climate Change Impact Study – Phase 1 
Page 210 
  
 
HeatUsey,m is the monthly usage multiplier. 
 
The heating equipment index is composed of electric space heating equipment saturation 
levels normalized by operating efficiency levels.  The index will change over time with 
changes in heating equipment saturations (HeatShare) and operating efficiencies (Eff).  
Formally, the equipment index is defined as:

In this expression, 2013 is used as a base year for normalizing the index.  The ratio on the 
right is equal to 1.0 in 2013.  In other years, it will be greater than one if equipment 
saturation levels are above their 2013 level.  This will be counteracted by higher efficiency 
levels, which will drive the index downward.  Base year space heating sales are defined as 
follows.

Here, base-year sales for space heating is the product of the average space heating intensity 
value and the ratio of total commercial sales in the base year over the sum of the end-use 
intensity values.  In the Commercial SAE Spreadsheets, the space heating sales value is 
defined on the BaseYrInput tab.  The resulting HeatIndexy value in 2013 will be equal to the 
estimated annual heating sales in that year.  Variations from this value in other years will be 
proportional to saturation and efficiency variations around their base values.   
 
Heating system usage levels are impacted on a monthly basis by several factors, including 
weather, commercial level economic activity, prices and billing days.  Using the EPRI 
COMMEND model’s default elasticity parameters, the estimates for space heating equipment 
usage levels are computed as follows:

CEcon is a commercial economic driver, combining real commercial output and 
employment in year (y).  Output is assigned a weight of 0.30 and employment of 
0.70. (These values may also be modified by the individual user.) 
 
By construction, the HeatUsey,m variable has an annual sum that is close to one in the base 
year (2013).  The heating degree days serve to allocate annual values to months of the year.  
The remaining terms average to one in the base year.  In other years, the values will reflect 
changes in commercial economic driver.   
 
 
B-2.3 Constructing XCool 
The explanatory variable for cooling loads is constructed in a similar manner.  The amount of 
energy used by cooling systems depends on the following types of variables.   
 
 
Cooling degree days, 
 
Cooling equipment saturation levels, 
 
Cooling equipment operating efficiencies,  
 
Average number of days in the billing cycle for each month, and 
 
Commercial output and energy price. 
 
The cooling variable is represented as the product of an equipment-based index and monthly 
usage multiplier.  That is,   
 
 
(7) 
where, XCooly,m is estimated cooling energy use in year (y) and month (m),  
CoolIndexy is an index of cooling equipment, and  
CoolUsey,m is the monthly usage multiplier. 
 
As with heating, the cooling equipment index depends on equipment saturation levels 
(CoolShare) normalized by operating efficiency levels (Eff). Formally, the cooling equipment 
index is defined as:

saturation levels are above their 2013 level.  This will be counteracted by higher efficiency 
levels, which will drive the index downward.  Estimates of base year cooling sales are

Here, base-year sales for space cooling is the product of the average space cooling intensity 
value and the ratio of total commercial sales in the base year over the sum of the end-use 
intensity values.  In the Commercial SAE Spreadsheets, the space cooling sales value is 
defined on the BaseYrInput tab.  The resulting CoolIndex value in 2013 will be equal to the 
estimated annual cooling sales in that year.  Variations from this value in other years will be 
proportional to saturation and efficiency variations around their base values.   
 
Cooling system usage levels are impacted on a monthly basis by several factors, including
