Ripple Effect: How Value Chains 
Compound Sector Exposures  
To Physical Climate Risks 
March 13, 2025 
Exposures to physical climate risks in many companies' value chains can lead to--and possibly 
compound--vulnerability to operational and financial risks, if unaddressed.  
This research report explores an evolving topic relating to sustainability. It reflects research conducted by and contributions 
from S&P Global Ratings’ sustainability research team as well as our credit rating analysts (where listed).

Exposures of companies to physical climate risks inherited through value chains may be 
significant. This is more the case for companies operating in sectors with long and/or complex 
value chains, or those that rely on the natural environment. In this research, we seek to enhance 
understanding of sectors' exposures to physical climate risks. We do so by looking beyond direct 
exposures to estimate those transmitted between sectors through value-chain networks.  
Using economic input-output data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), we first 
build value-chain models at the sector level that express the economic inputs and dependencies 
between sectors. We then layer into these sector value-chain models the direct exposures of 
different sectors to nine climate hazards. These exposures are drawn from the S&P Global 
Sustainable1 Physical Climate Risk dataset. This allows us to estimate the exposures to physical 
climate risks each sector inherits from the sectors in its value chain.  
We focus on the potential impacts, or risks, to sectors downstream of the climate hazard event, 
rather than potential opportunities. This research augments understanding of how climate 
hazards might transmit through value chains and lead to potentially material credit impacts.

Key Findings  
• 
Companies may be underestimating their exposures to physical climate risks if they 
fail to consider value-chain exposures in their risk analyses. In turn, they may also be 
underestimating potential operational and financial impacts.  
• 
Sectors such as agribusiness, consumer (food), and autos, which rely heavily on more 
climate sensitive upstream sectors, exhibit the highest value-chain exposures, under a 
slow climate transition scenario (SSP3-7.0). However, all sectors inherit at least some 
physical climate risk exposures from their value chains. 
• 
Some sectors have relatively lower direct exposures to physical climate risks, but 
nevertheless have meaningful value-chain exposures. For these sectors, failure to 
properly identify and manage these indirect risks could lead to financial or operational 
impacts. 
• 
We consider evolving climate risks in our credit analysis. Intensifying climate hazards, 
such as rising sea levels and changes in rainfall patterns, may transform industries and 
business processes. Whether physical climate risks related to value chains have material 
credit impacts depends on many issuer specificities. 
Consistent with our criteria, our 
credit ratings incorporate the 
adverse physical effects of climate 
change--that are sufficiently visible 
and material--along with all other 
factors material to our assessment 
of creditworthiness. 
We do this when we believe such 
impacts could materially influence 
the creditworthiness of a rated 
entity or issue and we have 
sufficient visibility on how they will 
evolve or manifest.  
The findings of this research are 
currently not part of our base case 
analysis, given the uncertainties 
inherent in climate projections.

Physical Climate Risks Are Rising For Many Companies 
Extreme weather events and chronic physical climate risks are worsening in many regions. 
Globally, economic losses reached $320 billion in 2024, up from an inflation-adjusted $268 billion 
in 2023. This is greater than the inflation-adjusted averages of the past 10 and 30 years, 
according to Munich Re, a global reinsurance company.  
Economic losses from worsening climate hazards are also growing. Exposure to extreme 
weather events and chronic changes in climate is rising. Companies and governments may have 
to divert more of their budgets to addressing the risks posed by climate hazards. 
Risk isn’t isolated to an entity’s own assets and operations. An entity or a sector’s exposure to 
physical climate risks includes not only its direct exposure but also indirect exposure via its value 
chain. Whether due to commodity shortages, geopolitical tensions, logistical bottlenecks, or 
other causes, disruptions that originate in the value chain can reverberate outward. This can have 
meaningful operational and/or financial impacts on downstream sectors that depend on the 
inputs of critical goods and services.  
A November 2024 report by S&P Global Market Intelligence, “Big Picture 2025 Supply Chain 
Outlook: Dealing With Consequences,” argues the effects of worsening climate hazards on supply 
chains, a key component of value chains, can be significant for sectors and individual entities. 
This should be a growing focus of decision-makers’ in siting and sourcing decisions, according to 
the report.  
Impacts from climate hazards on individual companies can be substantial and compounded 
through value chains. This is despite such hazards often being temporary in nature and 
sometimes limited to specific sectors and/or geographies. Recent acute and chronic physical 
climate risks have caused many notable impacts, which have often cascaded through sectors via 
value chains.  
• 
Climate hazards affecting the River Rhine in Germany have led to disruptions numerous 
times in the past few years. In 2021, the river burst its banks due to heavy rainfall and excess 
snowmelt, disrupting shipping for several days. The Rhine is one of Europe’s most important 
commercial waterways for commodities such as grains and minerals. The most heavily 
affected states--North Rhine-Westphalia, and Rhineland-Palatinate--also incurred extensive 
damage to houses, roads, bridges and other infrastructure (see “Germany And Affected 
States Can Absorb Response To Devastating Floods,” published July 21, 2021).  
A few months later, lower-than-expected rainfall forced cargo ships to reduce their loads by 
half to avoid grounding. Low water levels again in 2023 saw similar impacts, with vessel 
operators passing costs to cargo owners to compensate for vessels sailing at reduced 
capacity, as reported by Reuters. In each case, impacts cascaded through sectors. The 
energy sector saw significant delays, albeit temporarily, to coal, oil, and gas shipments. 
Agribusinesses and their downstream customers, meanwhile, suffered disruptions to fertilizer 
and grain imports. The projected impacts of a month with 30 days of low water levels in the 
River Rhine on Germany’s GDP would be 1%, according to 2023 research led by Martin 
Ademmer.  
• 
In early 2023, authorities restricted both the number and size of ships passing through the 
Panama Canal. The restrictions, enacted by the Panama Canal Authority, followed one of the 
driest years on record and historically low water levels in Lake Gatun. The canal is one of the 
busiest shipping routes in the world, carrying about 3% of world trade by volume each year. 
The result was disruption to global shipping, prompting shippers across both the bulk and 
containerized segments to shift their operations and cover higher costs. The Panama Canal

Authority has since announced an $8.5 billion investment to tackle water scarcity and 
enhance infrastructure. The project includes constructing the Rio Indio Lake and should help 
provide additional water resources and guarantee sustained reliability for the next 50 years 
(see “Tear Sheet: Autoridad del Canal de Panama S.A.,” Dec. 23, 2024). 
• 
In Brazil, heavy flooding in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in May 2024 caused significant 
disruption within specific supply chains. This affected the value chains of agricultural 
commodities such as soybeans, wheat, and tobacco, as well as auto parts. It was due to 
damage to roads, seaports, and airports. The state accounted for more than 93% of Brazil’s 
total tobacco exports in the 12-months through to April 30, 2024 (see “Floods In Brazil’s Rio 
Grande Do Sul State Disrupt Supply Chain,” published June 4, 2024). Many of the corporate 
entities we rate had to halt operations for several days (see “Floods Could Amplify Logistics 
And Inflationary Strains On Some Brazilian Corporate Sectors,” published May, 10. 2024).  
The complexity and interdependencies of companies’ value chains also contribute to 
significant disruption and additional costs. Where value chains are more sophisticated with 
more specialized inputs being traded, there are generally fewer substitution options. This 
increases the potential for greater transmission of the shock. For example, flooding in Thailand in 
2011 caused significant disruption to supply of hard drives and semiconductors. This reached 
downstream companies in sectors including autos and electronics.  
Some companies’ value chains--particularly those in specialized sectors such as semiconductors 
(see “TSMC And Water: A Case Study Of How Climate Is Becoming A Credit-Risk Factor,” 
published Feb. 26, 2024)--may be highly geographically concentrated in more exposed regions. 
This increases sensitivity of those networks (and those that rely on them) to climate shocks. The 
impacts of physical climate risks on companies’ value chains can therefore cause ripple effects 
over much wider areas, further compounding economic losses in less developed countries where 
recovery is often slower (see “Is Climate Change Another Obstacle To Economic Development,” 
published Jan. 16, 2023). 
More frequent and severe physical climate risks can pose threats to companies with impacts 
that are not evenly distributed. By 2030, if mitigation is not stepped up, the number of climate-
related disasters could be 40% higher than in 2015, according to a 2022 UN Office for Disaster 
Risk Reduction report. There could be about 250 events globally per year in such a scenario, the 
report states. And impacts will vary. Our research suggests that lower- and lower-middle income 
countries are up to 4.4x more exposed to climate hazards than more developed economies. 
These economies have the least capacity to adapt (see “Lost GDP: Potential Impacts Of Physical 
Climate Risks," Nov. 27, 2023).  
Two factors may contribute to increased value-chain vulnerability of lower- and lower-middle 
income countries following climate events. First, these economies have higher concentrations of 
natural resources such as minerals, agricultural products, and oil and gas. Second, they tend to 
focus on primary resource extraction and manufacturing.  
Companies’ progress on adapting to the physical impacts of climate change is not keeping 
pace with worsening climate hazards. Only about one-fifth of companies have adaptation plans 
and less than half plan to implement their adaptation plans within the next decade, based on 
analysis of 6,871 company disclosures in the 2022 S&P Global Sustainable1 Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment (CSA). This leaves some companies vulnerable (see “Risky Business: 
Companies' Progress On Adapting To Climate Change,” published April 3, 2024).  
Supply chain management is also not widely considered a top material issue. According to 
responses from 12,490 companies to the CSA in 2023 (see chart 1), only 6.5% of companies chose 
supply chain management as a top material issue (see “Assessing The Missing Links In Supply

Chain Management,” published April 30, 2024). In combination, worsening climate hazards and 
the limited progress made by some companies on adapting to those risks may contribute to 
reduced reliability of their value chains--more so for those companies that are more sensitive to 
the physical impacts of climate change.

contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders and respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations. It 
usually includes at least three components: human rights and labor, environment, and business ethics. Source: S&P Global

Physical Climate Risk: Pervasive And Possibly Hidden  
According to the S&P Global Sustainable1 Physical Climate Risk dataset, the five sectors most 
directly exposed to nine physical climate risks (see box below) are agribusiness, forest and paper 
products, consumer (food), chemicals, and building materials (see chart 2). All sectors face at 
least moderate exposure, where the projected average sensitivity-weighted composite score this 
decade is between 30 to 69 out of 100.  
The sensitivity-weighted composite score (hereafter, direct exposure) represents a sector’s own 
direct exposure to changing climate hazards. Asset locations drive direct sector exposures to 
physical climate risks, which remain highly context and location specific.  
The data used to calculate the direct exposures, therefore, captures the exposure of companies’ 
assets to all nine climate hazards averaged over the 2020-2029 period under a slow transition 
climate scenario (SSP3-7.0). This scenario equates to a rise in temperature from pre-industrial 
levels of about 2.1 C by 2050, or 3.6 C by the end of the century. Projected data is available until 
the end of the century.  
Given the lock-in effect of historical greenhouse gas emissions, many physical risks of climate 
change will materialize regardless of today’s policy choices. This is particularly the case for 
timepoints before the midcentury, as outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC’s) Sixth Assessment Report: Summary For Policymakers. Countries’ current commitments, 
if met, align with a global temperature increase of 2.4C to 2.6C by 2100, according to the United 
Nations Environment Program. This is similar to SSP2-4.5. In this research we present findings 
using SSP3-7.0 through to 2050, which reflects this lock-in effect, and inherent challenges and 
uncertainties associated with long-term projections.  
 
 
What Do The Exposure Scores Mean?  
The S&P Global Sustainable1 Physical Climate Risk dataset provides point-in-time exposure 
to climate hazards relative to global conditions. The exposure scores are normalized on a 
scale from 1 (lowest exposure) to 100 (highest exposure), representing the exposure of a 
given location to nine different climate hazards including extreme heat, extreme cold, 
wildfire, drought, water stress, coastal flooding (sea level rise), fluvial flooding (severe river 
flooding), pluvial flooding (severe rainfall), and storms (tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and 
typhoons). The exposure score represents the relative level of exposure for each climate 
hazard at each location, relative to global conditions and is available for four Shared 
Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and timescales to the end of the century.  
An exposure score between 1-29 out of 100 is considered low, while 30-69 is moderate, and 
70-100 highly exposed.

through banks’ and insurance companies’ financed assets. Note: The Sensitivity Adjusted Composite Physical Risk 
Exposure Score (“direct” exposure) is intended to account for both exposure to climate hazards, and the expected 
sensitivity of companies and assets to each hazard, based on company-level data on water, capital, and labor intensity. 
Values from 30-69 are considered moderately exposed. Scoring scale 1 to 100 (most exposed/sensitive). Source: S&P 
Global Sustainable1, S&P Global Ratings. 
The adaptation and resilience interventions required will vary. They will depend on where the 
companies’ assets are located and the sensitivity of those assets to climate hazards. For 
example, companies with operations that are water intensive are likely to be more sensitive to 
constrained water supply and/or increased water costs than those that are less water intensive.  
Likewise, extreme heat events reduce labor productivity more when work is conducted outdoors-
-such as in agriculture--due to heat stress and its impact on human health, than when activity is 
indoors, such as in the services sectors. In addition, companies in sectors with a lot of fixed 
assets--such as those in real estate or transportation infrastructure--face greater exposure to 
physical climate risks because they cannot be easily moved away from climate hazards (see 
"Corporate Physical Assets Increasingly In Harm's Way As Climate Change Intensifies," published 
Oct. 1, 2021).

More than half of sectors are projected to be more exposed to direct physical climate risks 
than the cross-sector average in the 2020s, absent adaptation. S&P Global Sustainable1's 
Physical-Risk Sensitivity-Weighted Composite Exposure Scores found 62% of sectors, or 18 of 29, 
will face higher exposure. The scores are based on the direct exposure of over 20,000 companies' 
assets, covering more than 98% of global market capitalization (see chart 2). The dataset 
captures the expected sensitivity of companies’ assets to nine climate hazards. It excludes any 
value-chain exposures, such as through banks’ and insurance companies’ financed assets or food 
and beverage companies’ exposure to a raw material input.  
Direct sector exposure may not represent total exposure 
Some sectors with complex and/or long value chains fall below the sector average direct 
exposure score. This is the case, for example, for companies in the engineering and construction 
and retailing (nonfood) sectors. Nevertheless, the impacts from physical climate risks could be 
significant where companies in those sectors face high indirect exposure to climate hazards in 
their value chains, absent adaptation to those risks.  
For example, the retailing (nonfood) sector may rely on apparel companies in the consumer 
(nonfood) sector whose own suppliers rely on materials such as textiles, metals, plastics, and 
wood. The sector could be more indirectly exposed as worsening climate hazards affect 
agricultural outputs such as cotton. Those risks may spread to more sectors linked to the 
agricultural value chain (see “Agricultural Industry Is Still Sweating This Year’s Droughts,” Oct. 13, 
2022). Understanding the full extent of sectoral exposure to physical climate risks, therefore, 
requires a view on these value-chain exposures. 
How we assess physical climate risk in value chains 
In this analysis, we estimate sector indirect exposures to physical climate risks through value 
chains. We focus on value chains rather than just supply chains. As explained in greater detail in 
the Appendix, value chains include all value-add activities, as captured in the U.S. BEA data. This 
value may come from activities outside of what is commonly considered part of a product supply 
chain, which typically includes just the steps required to transform raw materials into finished 
goods and deliver them to market. 
To estimate the physical climate risk exposures inherited by sectors from their value chains, we 
take a three-step approach (see chart 3).  
• 
Step 1: We examine economic relationships between sectors by building value-chain models 
for each sector, using input-output supply data from the U.S. BEA to determine the 
proportion of a sector’s total output that comes from a contributing sector’s input. We use 
these percentages as the basis for estimating how physical risk realized in one sector might 
be passed onto other sectors.  
• 
Step 2: To calculate the physical climate risk exposure one sector inherits from another via its 
value chain, we use the quantitative economic relationships (represented as percentages) 
established in the value-chain models as weightings and multiply them by each contributing 
sector’s direct physical risk exposure. 
• 
Step 3: To calculate each sector’s overall value chain physical risk exposure, we sum the 
internal value chain and each upstream sector’s weighted value-chain exposures.

from five upstream sectors. “Exposure” refers to physical climate risk exposure. Source: S&P Global Ratings. 
Inherited Value-Chain Exposure Can Be Sizeable 
All sectors inherit at least some physical climate risk exposure from their value chains (see chart 
4). However, the magnitude of value-chain exposures to physical climate risks are 
heterogeneous.  
The agribusiness sector has the greatest exposure to physical climate hazards through its 
value chain. That is under a slow transition scenario, SSP3-7.0 (see chart 4). We expect those 
sectors that rely more heavily on their value chains for contributions to their own output--such as 
agribusiness, chemicals, or autos--will see the most pronounced value chain exposure. This 
effect can be particularly acute for sectors heavily reliant on more highly exposed upstream 
sectors. 
The consumer (food) sector is a particularly strong example of a sector with upstream 
exposures that compound already high direct exposures. The consumer (food) sector depends 
on its value chain for nearly 71% of its output (the highest percentage of all 29 sectors; see Table 
A1 in the Appendix). And agribusiness--the sector with the greatest direct exposure--alone 
contributes 32.2% of value to consumer (food) companies. Consequently, companies in this 
sector aiming to most effectively manage their inherited exposures to climate hazards may 
consider looking beyond their own assets and operations to their key upstream agribusiness 
suppliers.  
We describe the components that we may use to assess the efficacy of companies’ adaptation 
plans in “Risky Business: Companies' Progress On Adapting To Climate Change,” published April 
3, 2024. We view adaptation plans that can demonstrate a greater number of these components 
as advanced and believe companies with such plans are likely to be well placed to adapt to and 
cope with physical climate risks.

sensitivity of companies to climate hazards is based on company-level data on water, capital, and labor intensity. Source: 
U.S. BEA, S&P Global Sustainable1, S&P Global Ratings. 
Other sectors, such as building materials, could also see significant inherited physical climate 
risk exposures from their value chains. This is because companies in the chemicals and metals 
and mining sectors--which include fixed assets like factories, mines, and specialist processing 
facilities--contribute nearly a quarter of the value of the building materials sector’s total output.  
Not all value chain exposures are inherited from upstream sectors--internal sector value 
chains can also exacerbate a sector’s exposure to physical climate risks. The chemicals sector 
provides a good example. Chemicals companies depend on other companies in the same sector, 
such as those that process raw materials or produce specialty chemicals inputs, for 34.2% of the 
value of their output (see table A1 in the Appendix). This trade within the sector, therefore, 
compounds the high direct exposures it already faces. Chemical companies face direct physical 
climate risks threatening their own facilities and those risks facing peers within their sector on 
which they rely. 
Power generators (30%) and real estate (34%) are examples of sectors that draw relatively 
less value from their value chains. They therefore see relatively modest value chain exposures 
(see chart 4).

Value-chain exposures can be considered with direct exposures 
Some sectors see relatively high exposure to climate hazards from both direct and value chain 
sources. The consumer (food), agribusiness, autos, and chemicals sectors are among the most 
exposed sectors in terms of both direct and value-chain exposures (see top right quadrant of 
chart 5). It is these sectors that face outsize exposures, absent efforts to adapt and build 
resilience to worsening climate hazards. There may also be cases where a sector may have less 
direct exposure to climate hazards but comparatively greater exposure through their value 
chains. 
Sectors with relatively lower direct exposures may nevertheless have comparatively higher 
value-chain exposures. Airline companies, for instance, are themselves not highly exposed to 
climate hazards. However, they rely heavily on airport operators and other entities in the 
transportation infrastructure sector, and thus, may be more greatly exposed to both acute and 
chronic climate hazards (see “Scenario Analysis Shines A Light On Climate Exposure: Focus On 
Major Airports,” published Nov. 5, 2020, and “ESG Materiality Map: Airlines,” published July 20, 
2022) through these entities. Consequently, while airlines ranks as the 26th most directly 
exposed sector (out of 29) in our analysis, it is 13th from a value-chain perspective. 
The value-chain exposure of the oil and gas sector moves it from the 25th most exposed sector 
when looking just at direct exposures, to the 8th most exposed from its value-chain 
exposures. The oil and gas sector derives about 64% of its total output value from its value chain. 
Other companies within the sector (internal value chain) account for 44% of total value. However, 
a further 20% of value comes from upstream sectors that are generally more highly exposed to 
climate shocks, such as chemicals and metals and mining (see table A1 in the Appendix for a full 
breakdown of sector value contributions).

The data can be helpful for examining the precise source of value-chain exposures. For 
example, the autos sector depends on contributions from many sectors for the value of its 
output (see table A1 in the Appendix). This contrasts with the consumer (food) sector, which 
inherits substantial exposure from just one upstream sector (agribusiness). Certain upstream 
sectors for autos, such as metals and mining and capital goods, may be particularly exposed to 
worsening climate hazards, such as flooding and extreme temperatures. These hazards can 
damage assets and/or cause disruption. The autos sector also depends heavily on its own 
internal value chain (that is, auto parts manufacturers supplying auto companies), which alone 
contributes 43.7% of the sector’s value-chain exposure to physical climate risks (see chart 6).

By the 2050s, value-chain exposures to climate hazards rise for all 
sectors in a slow transition scenario (SSP3-7.0), absent adaptation 
With more time and under more severe warming scenarios, economies could see rising losses 
across all scenarios and timepoints. By 2050, if global warming does not stay well below 2 C, up 
to 4.4% of the world’s GDP could be lost annually, absent adaptation (see “Lost GDP: Potential 
Impacts Of Physical Climate Risks,” Nov. 27, 2023). Faced with worsening climate hazards, and 
without adaptation and resilience investments, companies in the most climate-sensitive sectors 
could see outsize impacts on both their own assets and operations and those in value chain 
partners on which they rely. 
Across all sectors, we find direct and value-chain risk exposure to potential climate impacts is 
set to rise by more than 8% by 2050, under a slow transition scenario (SSP3-7.0) and absent 
adaptation. While this is based on a static view of sectoral distributions and geographical

locations in the economy, it informs us of the rising importance of climate risks, all other things 
equal. It suggests companies will increasingly be forced to actively manage this risk directly and 
within their supply-chains. Any active management would be a mitigating factor not accounted 
for by our metrics. It can affect the risk distribution by 2050.  
Importantly, direct sector physical climate risk exposure is projected to increase for 93% of 
sectors--27 of 29--by the 2050s. Sectors with the greatest increase in direct exposure by 
midcentury are those with comparatively more fixed assets (see table 1). These include oil and 
gas (19.9% increase, or a rise in direct physical climate risk exposure score of 8.3 points); real 
estate (16.7%, 7.2 points); utilities (16.4%, 8.4 points); and midstream energy (14.5%, 6.4 points).  
Sectors that have links to the natural environment such as forest and paper products (10.9%, 
6.4 points) and agribusiness (9.8%, 6.4 points) also see significant increases in direct exposure 
by midcentury under SSP3-7.0. The implication is that companies in highly exposed sectors will 
continue to face outsized exposure to worsening climate hazards, absent adaptation. We have 
previously described the relatively limited progress made by many companies in addressing 
adaptation (see “Risky Business: Companies' Progress On Adapting To Climate Change,” 
published April 3, 2024). Among consumer staples companies, which includes consumer (food), 
agribusinesses, and forest and paper products companies, only 23% (119 of 519) disclosed that 
they have an adaptation and resilience plan. 
Value-chain physical climate risk exposure is projected to increase for all sectors by the 
2050s. This is under SSP3-7.0, absent adaptation and assuming that sector value contributions 
remain constant. As a consequence, managing the impacts posed by worsening climate hazards 
to companies’ value chains are likely to be increasingly important for those sectors with the 
greatest change in value-chain exposure, where those risks are not otherwise being managed. 
The sectors with the greatest increases in value chain exposure by the 2050s are: oil and gas 
(15.7% increase, or a rise in value-chain exposure to climate hazards of 4.4 points), agribusiness 
(10.8%, 4.2 points), chemicals (10%, 3.7 points) and forest and paper products (10%, 3.4 points). 
Across all sectors, value-chain exposures increase on average by 8.2%.

Results may misstate total sector physical climate risk exposures  
We identify three primary reasons why the value chain physical risk exposure estimates may be 
under- or overstated, with additional analytical limitations identified in the appendix: 
• 
Our value-chain models are based on the value-added contribution to total output. However, 
the degree to which one sector relies on another may not be fully reflected in that value 
contribution. For instance, an automaker may require a relatively low value component to 
complete and ship a car. That part may contribute little value, but its absence could severely 
disrupt the automaker’s ability to get its products to market.  
• 
Our analysis does not account for potential secondary (and compounding) effects as value-
chain exposures feed back into and contribute to higher direct physical climate risk 
exposures used to calculate upstream exposures. 
• 
Our approach assumes that climate hazard exposures are independent. That is, the likelihood 
of occurrence and any associated impacts-- should they materialize-- of a specific climate 
hazard is unrelated to the annual frequency and impact of all other climate hazards.

Value Chains And Credit Risk: Constantly Evolving 
As identified in our Oct. 17, 2023, report “Supply-Chain Risks: A Credit Perspective,” S&P Global 
Ratings takes into consideration disruptions where their materiality and severity could dampen 
the capacity and willingness of an entity to meet its financial commitments. The report identifies 
negative ratings actions related to supply chain events on more than 200 corporate issuers 
between 2020 and the end of 2022.  
Physical climate hazards are among those risks that could cause material value-chain 
disruptions. However, the actual financial impact of a physical climate hazard in the value chain 
will depend on the nature of the impact and unique characteristics of a company. Among other 
things, exposure to physical climate risks is heterogenous, and the geography of one company’s 
value chain may differ substantially from that of its broader sector. These factors can increase or 
decrease sensitivity to climate hazards.  
The total value-chain-adjusted sector physical climate risk exposures provide directional 
insight into the degree of upstream exposure to climate hazards. For entity level analysis, it is 
therefore important to consider the specific channels through which physical climate risks may 
be transmitted through value chains leading to financial impact. Considering company-specific 
factors that may increase or decrease the likelihood of these impacts materializing is also 
important. 
Factors can offset or exacerbate potential impacts of value-chain risk 
Here we explore the key transmission channels through which these risks can lead to financial 
impacts and the individual company or value-chain characteristics that can either exacerbate or 
mitigate that exposure. 
Value-chain risks may manifest as financial risks through three key transmission channels. 
These are operational disruption, increased input costs, and/or adaptation and resilience 
investments (see chart 7).  
• 
Business disruption or downtime: Physical climate events, particularly those impacting 
upstream materials or production sites and transportation infrastructure hubs, can lead to 
delays in accessing critical inputs, disruptions in production, or the ability to deliver products 
or services to market, with direct effects on revenue generation.  
• 
Changes in input and production costs: The effects of physical climate risks can limit input 
supply and increase input material prices, force companies to source from more expensive 
suppliers, or increase transportation and logistics costs resulting in margin pressures.  
• 
Costs of adaptation and resilience measures: Exposure to physical climate risks may prompt 
investments associated with adapting business or supply-chain models to build resilience and 
more proactively mitigate exposures, adding near-term costs even if they prove to be 
beneficial in the longer term.

The sensitivity of any one company to these transmission channels will hinge on certain 
attributes of its value-chain structure. These include:  
• 
Geographic concentration: Because climate events are location specific (though the scope of 
geographic impact can vary widely), geographic concentration of a company’s suppliers, 
nodes of transport (such as seaports), critical input materials, or costumer markets could 
heighten the risk that a weather event creates a material disruption. The semiconductor 
industry, on which many downstream companies rely, for instance, is heavily concentrated in 
East Asia, and Taiwan and South Korea in particular.  
• 
Supply-chain model: The supply-chain or sourcing model that a company employs can 
influence whether a disruption can be more easily managed. A just-in-time model, for 
instance, may be more vulnerable to impacts from a disruption. This is because a company 
may not have the inventory on hand to bridge the supply gap a disruption causes. Like 
geographic concentration, a heavy reliance on a few strategic suppliers may introduce further 
vulnerabilities to weather-based disruptions. On the other hand, strategic relationships with a 
few key suppliers may enhance a company’s ability to work with those suppliers on more 
actively managing risk and building resilience to climate hazards. 
• 
Substitutability of inputs: A company that relies on more specialized inputs is likely to be 
more vulnerable to material financial impacts arising from value-chain disruptions. Greater 
substitutability of inputs (and the suppliers of those inputs), on the other hand, increases the 
likelihood that a company could quickly find viable alternatives, at reasonable prices, 
elsewhere.

spglobal.com/ratings/SustainabilityInsights 
March 13, 2025

• 
Redundancy and planning: Companies that proactively monitor physical risks plan for 
potential disruption can be expected to respond more quickly and effectively to manage the 
potentially deleterious impacts of a physical climate event in their value chains.  
• 
Where in the value chain a physical climate risk resides can also influence a company’s 
ability to manage it. If the physical climate risk exposure exists in a company’s tier 1 supplier 
base, they are likely to have greater visibility into and control over managing and mitigating 
those risks, for instance, through working with strategic suppliers on resilience measures or 
by diversifying the geographic concentration of its suppliers. If the risks, however, reside 
further up a value chain--such as with raw materials--companies are likely to have less 
visibility into and ability to manage those risks effectively. And the measures available to 
adapt with tier 1 suppliers (such as geographic diversity) may be offset by, for instance, heavy 
geographic concentration of tier 2 or above suppliers.  
We consider climate risks in our credit rating analysis  
Climate change is a megatrend that has a magnitude we would typically consider high. This is 
because of both climate transition risks and physical climate risks. The impact of climate change 
ranges from the potential disruption on a company’s business model due to economies moving 
away from reliance on fossil fuels to the increasing frequency and severity of physical climate 
risks due to a rise in temperature, even under the global scientific consensus’ most optimistic 
transition scenario.  
We find that clarity of how physical climate and climate transition risks are transmitted to 
creditworthiness and, ultimately to credit ratings is generally low. For physical climate risks, 
this is due to the inherent unpredictability of the timing and extent of climate hazards. Similarly 
for climate transition risks, many aspects of the transition are still evolving, including technology, 
public policy, and market changes or requirements related to mitigating climate change (see 
“Assessing How Megatrends May Influence Credit Ratings,” published April 18, 2024).  
We consider uncertainty about the effects of climate change in our credit analysis. Our long-
term issuer credit ratings do not have predetermined time horizons. The uncertainty about when 
and how a credit factor can change can be very high. With risks related to climate change--which 
can have a high magnitude should an event occur, and low clarity of how these risks are 
transmitted to credit risk--we would typically continue monitoring it without necessarily making 
specific assumptions about it in our analysis. However, as the timing and likelihood of events 
become clearer, we may incorporate the impact of those risks into our view of creditworthiness. 
We therefore analyze long-dated risks such as climate risk exposure: These megatrends may be 
slow moving, but they can transform industries and business processes in fundamental ways.  
In “Evolving Risks In North American Corporate Ratings,” published Oct. 29, 2024, and “Evolving 
Risks In North American Corporate Ratings: Supply Chain Disruption,” published Oct. 29, 2024, we 
outlined some megatrends. These included climate change (climate transition risks and physical 
climate risks) and supply-chain disruptions. We considered their impact on North American 
corporate sectors, and how they may influence credit quality.  
Looking Ahead 
More frequent and severe climate hazards are increasingly exposing companies to impacts, 
touching all sectors in some way--and to varying extents-- without efforts to adapt. Investments 
in adaptation and resilience may protect companies and countries from climate shocks.  
Sustainability Insights | Research:  Ripple Effect: How Value Chains Compound Sector Exposures To Physical Climate Risks 
spglobal.com/ratings/SustainabilityInsights 
March 13, 2025

There may be a positive externality--or ripple effect--of the benefit of adaptation and 
resilience investments. For example, companies with operations in countries that are better 
adapted to worsening climate hazards are more likely to indirectly benefit from more robust 
infrastructure. Policies that provide effective support in the face of, or following, climate shocks 
also can be of benefit. Adaptation in one sector may also contribute to the resilience of one or 
multiple downstream sectors via value-chain effects.  
Understanding companies’ value chain exposures to physical climate risks can also help 
prioritize areas where investments in adaptation and resilience may have the greatest impact 
on supply chain resilience. By analyzing specific vulnerabilities, investments may be directed 
toward adaptive solutions, such as infrastructure hardening and supply chain diversification. At 
the same time, those investments may foster innovation in terms of the technologies, products, 
or services that are needed to address the threats posed by worsening climate hazards.

Appendix 
Our approach to building sector value chain models and applying them to physical climate risk 
data to calculate sector value chain physical climate risk exposures is described below, followed 
by detailed sector-by-sector results in tables A1 and A2. Limitations of the approach and analysis 
are described thereafter. 
Estimating physical climate risk exposures from sector value chains 
To estimate the physical climate risk exposures inherited by sectors from their value chains, we 
take a three-step approach. Note that we describe our approach to building sector value chain 
models (step 1), including its limitations, in greater detail below. 
• 
Step 1: Build economic sector value chain models: We first examine the relationships 
between sectors through their value chains, based on the value contribution of one sector 
into the outputs of another sector. To do so, we use input-output supply data from the U.S. 
BEA. Input-output data provides insight into the interdependencies between different 
sectors, illustrating how the value of one sector’s total output might depend on inputs from 
other sectors. The total value of a sector’s output is the sum of value contributed by 
upstream sectors, the sector’s own internal value chain, and its direct value add (see 
definitions in the box below).  
 
• 
We use this data to identify sector-to-sector economic relationships based on the percentage 
of one sector’s output that is dependent upon another sector’s input. For example, according 
to the BEA data, for every $100 of output from the autos sector, $7.50 (or 7.5%) of that value 
comes from value contributed through inputs from the metals and mining sector (e.g. the 
steel that goes into the bodies of automobiles). These percentages can then be used as 
weightings in the next step to layer in the exposure of sectors to physical climate risks.  
• 
Step 2: Calculate each sector’s value-chain physical climate risk exposure: To then 
estimate the physical climate risk exposure each sector inherits from its value chain, we start 
with the sector direct physical climate risk exposures scores calculated using the Physical 
Climate Risk dataset from S&P Global Sustainable1. We then use the quantitative economic 
relationships established in the value-chain models, represented as percentages, as 
Definitions: Origin of value in a sector’s total output 
The total value of a sector’s output can come from three sources: 
Upstream: Value contributed by other sectors through input into the value of a given 
sector’s output. For example, a metals and mining company’s supply of steel to an autos 
company for the body of a car, or a business services company’s provision of strategic 
consulting services to an autos company. This also includes the value from indirect inputs, 
such as the raw materials that go into intermediate inputs supplied to a sector.  
Internal value chain:  The value a sector derives through inputs from entities from within its 
same sector. For example, an auto parts company supplying an auto manufacturer within 
the broader autos sector.   
Direct value add: A sector’s own value contribution through an entity’s value-add activities. 
For example, the value an auto manufacturer creates on its own by designing and 
assembling a car.

weightings and multiply them by each contributing sector’s (including upstream sectors and 
the sector’s own internal value chain) direct physical climate risk exposure score.  
• 
The metals and mining sector, for instance, has a direct physical climate risk exposure score 
of 55 out of 100 (scores between 30 and 69 out of 100 are considered moderately exposed) 
and contributes 7.5% of value to the autos sector. Autos therefore inherits 4.1 points (55 
multiplied by 0.075) of additional value-chain exposure from the metals and mining sector. 
See table A2 below for detail on each sector’s value chain exposures and the sectors that 
contribute those exposures. 
• 
Step 3: Calculate each sectors total value-chain exposure: To calculate the total value chain 
exposure of a sector, we sum the weighted physical climate risk exposures from all upstream 
sectors and the internal value chain to estimate the overall physical climate risk exposure 
inherited by a given sector from its value chain.   
Building sector value chain models (step 1) 
Input-output data provides insight into the economic relationships between sectors. Economic 
input-output data illustrate how sectors of the economy interact with one another, and 
specifically, how the output of one sector is used as an input by another sector for its own 
output. For example, the input-output data can show how much value the semiconductor 
industry contributes to the value of output from the consumer electronics industry.

Source: S&P Global Ratings. 
In this analysis, we use the September 2023 update of the U.S. BEA input-output accounts 
supply tables. This dataset provides a detailed account of how 402 individual industries, based 
on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), interact with one another through 
the contribution to or use of economic value. We map each of the BEA industries into our own 32

sector classifications and then calculate each sector’s use of value contributed from other 
sectors as a percentage of that sector’s total output value. In doing so, we create 32 individual 
sector value-chain models based on each sector’s economic relationships with other sectors (see 
Table A1 below for full detail on each sector’s input percentages). 
A value chain perspective is broader than a strictly supply chain approach. Because the data 
we use is based on value-added input, it is important to bear in mind that these value-chain 
models are broader in their perspective than a model that is strictly looking at the supply chain. 
The supply chain is more narrowly focused on the specific steps involved in transforming raw 
materials into finished goods and delivering those goods to market. Indeed, value can be added 
at all stages of a product or service lifecycle, including research and development at the early 
stages and business and customer service support in later stages (see chart A1).  
Value can be added from upstream sectors or from within a sector. Because we are analyzing 
value-added input at all stages of the product lifecycle and not according to a typical supply-
chain flow, we are concerned with the origin of value, whether from upstream sources, a sector’s 
internal value chain, or its own value-add activities (see the Definitions box above). 
As a consequence, each sector’s value-chain model can be broken down into value originating 
from three sources: 1) The value from the inputs coming from upstream sectors (either directly or 
through other upstream sectors). 2) The value from the sector’s internal value chain (such as an 
auto parts manufacturer supplying an auto manufacturer). 3) The value that entities within a 
sector originate directly (through, for instance, the assembly and marketing of a product).  
A sector’s total output value equals the sum of value coming from upstream inputs, internal 
sector value chain inputs, and the sector’s own value-add activities. This output can then be used 
as input into further production by downstream sectors or for end use by final consumers. 
Sectors exhibit varying degrees of economic dependency on upstream sectors relative to their 
own internal sector value chains and direct value add. Chart A2 breaks down the proportion 
each of our 32 sectors’ total output by origin of value. As can be seen, a sector’s reliance on value 
from upstream sectors can range substantially, from 55% of value from upstream sectors for the 
consumer (food) sector to just 13% for the pharmaceuticals sector. While some sectors are highly 
reliant on upstream value, sectors like pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, and technology hardware 
and semiconductors originate more value from within their own sector.  
Value also originates from a sector’s internal value chain and its direct value-add activities. 
For instance, the autos sector derives 60% of the value of outputs from within the sector. The 
origin of that 60% own-sector value contribution, however, is split almost evenly between the 
internal sector value chain (e.g. value from auto parts supplied to auto manufacturers) and the 
sector’s direct value-add activities (e.g. value from an auto manufacturer’s assembly of a finished 
car). By comparison, the technology software and services sector generates 64% of its output 
value from direct value-add activities, relying on the sector’s internal value chain for just 7.4% of 
value-add and the remaining 28.6% from upstream sectors.  
For each sector, we also derive the specific value contributions from other sectors. This 
approach allows us to break down the proportion of value contributed by other sectors. In the 
autos sector example presented in chart A3 below, for instance, we find that 40% of value comes 
from upstream sectors, most notably metals and mining (7.5%), capital goods (6.7%), building 
materials (3.5%), and chemicals (3.4%). And within each of these sectors we can take a more 
granular view on the specific commodity categories that are being utilized by the autos sector. 
From minerals and mining, for instance, the predominant upstream input into the Autos sector is 
steel flowing to automotive parts manufacturers.

These sectoral value-add contributions form the basis for weighting and estimating value-
chain exposures to physical climate risks. To apply these value chain models to the question of 
value chain physical climate risk exposure (which includes exposures from upstream sectors and 
the internal value chain), we weight risk exposure contributions from each upstream sector and 
the internal value chain by their percent value contribution to a sector’s total output. The 
aggregate of these exposures form the sector’s total value-chain physical risk exposure.

Limitations 
We describe some of the limitations and assumptions of our analysis below. This list is not 
exhaustive. 
• 
Economic dependency is just one measure of sectoral value chain relationships. We use 
value contribution in these models to provide the foundation for value chain exposures. We 
recognize, however, that this is just one perspective on and mechanism for measuring 
relationships between sectors and the likelihood that a risk embedded in a sector’s value 
chain might be transmitted to cause a meaningful impact. In some instances, economic value 
contribution may understate (or potentially overstate) real risk exposures. Take, for example, 
a sector that may only rely on a particular upstream component for a small percentage of the 
value-add in its final products, but without that component, or a viable substitute, the 
product is unworkable and cannot go to market. A disruption in the supply of that component 
can have substantial negative consequences, irrespective of its economic value contribution. 
• 
U.S. BEA input-output data is centered on the U.S. The BEA use tables provide information 
on input sectors globally. However, they are reflective of how sectors in the U.S. use those 
inputs from a value-add standpoint. While sectors in other geographic regions may exhibit 
different use patterns, we believe that U.S. sector use is broadly representative of global 
patterns, particularly given the U.S. economy’s relative size, complexity, diversity, and 
openness. While sectors in other locations may exhibit different patterns, we assume that 
they may not differ too much from the U.S. on average. That said, differences in regional 
company structures and business models are still likely. This reflects historical differences in 
local industry networks, and market and regulatory dynamics specific to each country. 
• 
Input-output data does not shed light on which phase in the value chain the value 
originates. While we can identify the sector of value origin, we cannot necessarily determine 
whether that value (and by extension, the value chain physical climate risk exposure) comes 
from, for example, tier 1 suppliers or further up the chain. Where the exposure originates has 
important implications for the degree to which an entity can actively and effectively manage 
that risk. If the risk is from a tier 1 supplier, with which an entity has a direct contractual 
relationship, the entity has more visibility into that risk and more levers at its disposal to 
manage the risk. If, on the other hand, the risk exposure resides with a tier 2 supplier or 
above, the entity may not have similar visibility and ability to manage. 
• 
U.S. BEA input -output data does not include the geographic origin on input. The BEA data 
used in this analysis is valuable for its level of commodity disaggregation. This allows us to 
map to our own sector classifications and view sector relationship dynamics at a more 
granular level. In contrast to other input-output datasets, this data does not include the 
geographic origin of input. The physical climate risk data we use from S&P Global Sustainable 
1 inherently embeds geographic exposures to physical climate hazards. However, we 
recognize that having data on the geographic origin of value (in addition to the sectoral origin 
of value) could further enhance our analysis and would be crucial for any issuer level analysis 
of value chain physical climate exposures. 
• 
Our analysis considers the exposure of entities to physical climate risks, but it does not 
capture the adaptation and resilience interventions either planned or in place. Due to data 
availability and the lack of comparable metrics, the measures that may be taken by 
companies to adapt and build resilience to the physical impacts of climate change are not 
factored into our analysis.
